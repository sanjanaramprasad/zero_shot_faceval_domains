0,044200e5-f15a-44e2-a77a-e850e8792891_gpt3_gen,"The ""Veterans Back and Spinal Therapy Act"" is a bill that aims to establish a pilot program that provides non-invasive techniques to treat spinal, back, and musculoskeletal injuries and pain to covered veterans. The bill states that spinal and back injuries are the most expensive musculoskeletal disorder to treat. The program will use an evidence-based medicine framework to assess the effectiveness of the non-invasive techniques. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will establish this pilot program and give preference to covered veterans who served in Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, or Operation New Dawn. The program will last for two years, and the Secretary will submit reports to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of each non-invasive technique provided. The bill defines non-invasive techniques as methods of treatment for spinal, back, and musculoskeletal injuries and pain other than surgery, including manual physical therapy, core strengthening and stabilization therapy, water exercise therapy, group exercise therapy, and pain management therapy.","SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans Back and Spinal Therapy 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) One in five members of the Armed Forces who were 
        wounded and evacuated from Afghanistan during the summer and 
        early fall of 2009 suffered a spinal injury, and at least 14 of 
        such members were left paralyzed or with loss of sensation.
            (2) In Afghanistan, members of the Armed Forces routinely 
        carry up to 33 percent more than the suggested maximum weight 
        and up to nearly 75 percent of a member's own body weight--
        routinely hefting combat gear that can exceed 120 pounds, 
        causing large numbers of spinal, back, and musculoskeletal 
        injuries and pain.
            (3) The use of massive improvised explosive devices by 
        insurgents against heavily armed mine resistant ambush 
        protected vehicles has significantly increased the number of 
        spinal, back, and musculoskeletal injuries and pain.
            (4) Advances in both body armor protection and medical 
        treatment have drastically decreased the number of deaths among 
        deployed members of the Armed Forces, but there has been an 
        increase in the number of members with spinal, back, and 
        musculoskeletal injuries and long-term pain.
            (5) Members of the Armed Forces returning from Iraq are 
        more likely to suffer lingering, debilitating injuries from 
        back and musculoskeletal pain than from battle wounds, 
        according to statistics compiled by the Secretary of Veterans 
        Affairs.
            (6) Diagnoses of ruptured spinal discs, compressed discs, 
        degenerative disc disease, and myofascial pain syndrome are 
        common in members of the Armed Forces returning from 
        Afghanistan and Iraq.
            (7) Spinal and back injuries are the most expensive 
        musculoskeletal disorder to treat.
            (8) Certain facilities of the Department of Veterans 
        Affairs offer outstanding non-invasive technologies for 
        treating spinal, back, and musculoskeletal injuries as well as 
        any accompanying mental health issues.
            (9) Traditional medical approaches to spinal, back, and 
        musculoskeletal injuries typically involve a combination of 
        long-term medication, surgery, and short-term physical therapy.
            (10) Using non-invasive techniques to treat veterans with 
        spinal, back, and musculoskeletal injuries can improve the 
        health outcomes for such veterans and drastically reduce the 
        long-term costs of care for such veterans by breaking the cycle 
        of expensive surgery followed by long-term pain medication that 
        often leads to addiction, depression, anxiety, and weight gain.
            (11) Non-invasive techniques that are not widely available 
        in medical facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs, 
        including manual physical therapy, core strengthening and 
        stabilization therapy, water exercise therapy, group exercise 
        therapy, and pain management therapy, should be evaluated in an 
        evidence-based medicine framework to assess their 
        effectiveness.

SEC. 3. PILOT PROGRAM TO PROVIDE VETERANS WITH NON-INVASIVE TECHNIQUES 
              FOR SPINAL, BACK, AND MUSCULOSKELETAL INJURIES.

    (a) Establishment.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall 
establish a pilot program to--
            (1) provide covered veterans with non-invasive techniques 
        to treat spinal, back, and musculoskeletal injuries and pain; 
        and
            (2) use an evidence-based medicine framework to assess the 
        effectiveness of such non-invasive techniques.
    (b) Scope.--
            (1) Size.--The pilot program shall include a representative 
        sample of covered veterans that is of sufficient size for the 
        Secretary to determine--
                    (A) the effectiveness and feasibility of providing 
                veterans with non-invasive techniques to treat spinal, 
                back, and musculoskeletal injuries and pain; and
                    (B) the unique considerations that exist with 
                respect to providing such treatment--
                            (i) to female veterans;
                            (ii) to veterans of various ages; and
                            (iii) to veterans located in various 
                        regions of the United States, including both 
                        urban and rural locations.
            (2) Preference.--In selecting covered veterans to 
        participate in the pilot program, the Secretary shall give 
        preference to covered veterans who served in Operation Enduring 
        Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, or Operation New Dawn.

Secretary shall--
            (1) determine the type of non-invasive technique to provide 
        to a covered veteran;
            (2) determine the effect of allowing self-referral by a 
        veteran to receive non-invasive techniques compared with 
        requiring a veteran to receive a referral from a physician for 
        non-invasive techniques; and
            (3) ensure the use of telehealth technology to provide 
        covered veterans who reside in rural locations (as determined 
        by the Secretary) with non-invasive techniques to treat spinal, 
        back, and musculoskeletal injuries and pain.
    (d) Partnership.--
            (1) University.--In administering the pilot program, the 
        Secretary shall seek to enter into an agreement with a 
        university affiliated with the Department of Veterans Affairs 
        to carry out the pilot program.
            (2) Selection.--In entering into an agreement with a 
        university under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall ensure that 
        the individuals who treat covered veterans with non-invasive 
        techniques for spinal, back, and musculoskeletal injuries and 
        pain--
                    (A) are trained to--
                            (i) effectively treat such veterans; and
                            (ii) recognize the unique experiences of 
                        such veterans, including experiences related to 
                        serving in Operation Enduring Freedom, 
                        Operation Iraqi Freedom, or Operation New Dawn; 
                        and
                    (B) use best practices and technologies with 
                respect to the non-invasive technique being used to 
                treat such veterans.
    (e) Duration.--The pilot program shall begin not later than March 
1, 2011, and shall continue for two years.

The Securities and Exchange Commission is responsible for taking measures to restrict the access of judgment evading foreign states to US capital markets. The Secretary of the Treasury is required to provide an annual report identifying each judgment evading foreign state, the basis of their designation, and the economic impact of their unsatisfied judgments. The Act also requires the Secretary to provide recommendations to Congress on additional measures to achieve the Act's objectives.","SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Judgment Evading Foreign States 
Accountability Act of 2008''.

SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.

    The purpose of this Act is to protect the economic interests of the 
United States and its citizens from the irresponsible conduct of 
certain foreign states, and agencies and instrumentalities of such 
states, that willfully refuse to satisfy United States court judgments.

SEC. 3. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Foreign states and instrumentalities that do business 
        or raise capital in the United States, and then refuse to 
        satisfy judgments of United States courts entered against them 
        in connection with disputes resulting from these activities, 
        inflict billions of dollars of damage on United States 
        taxpayers, and undermine the credibility of the United States 
        courts.
            (2) The Republic of Argentina is a recent and egregious 
        example of such behavior. Argentina has borrowed tens of 
        billions of dollars in the United States capital markets 
        through the issuance of bonds, notes, and other securities 
        pursuant to which it agreed to be subject to the jurisdiction 
        of the United States courts in actions relating to those bonds 
        notes and securities, and both waived and pledged not to assert 
        immunity in such actions. Argentina defaulted on its debt to 
        foreign creditors in 2001, and scores of judgments, totaling 
        more than $2,000,000,000, have been entered against it by the 
        United States courts based on its default. Rather than satisfy 
        these obligations, Argentina has expressed its intention never 
        to pay any of the resulting judgments.
            (3) Since its default in 2001, Argentina's economy has 
        recovered dramatically. This recovery has enabled Argentina to 
        accumulate foreign exchange reserves worth tens of billions of 
        dollars, and to use those reserves to pay some creditors 
        preferentially over United States citizens and holders of 
        United States court judgments.
            (4) Other foreign states have expressed interest in 
        following Argentina's lead. For example, the Republic of 
        Ecuador has recently threatened to default on and repudiate 
        part of its sovereign debt, citing Argentina's default 
        approvingly as a precedent.
            (5) Foreign states that engage in such behavior can infect 
        the management of businesses within their borders with their 
        profligate and irresponsible habits. When the lax ethical 
        standards that permit government officials to flout lawful 
        judgments corrupt the corporate behavior as well, the injury to 
        United States taxpayers is intensified.
            (6) United States taxpayers who are injured by such 
        irresponsible conduct often have little or no recourse. The 
        existing laws of the United States are highly protective of 
        foreign states, and public and private corporations of judgment 
        evading foreign states often enjoy a safe haven within their 
        home country's borders from those who are injured by their 
        behavior.
            (7) Action by the United States Government to combat this 
        growing problem must include measures that both protect United 
        States taxpayers against the irresponsible conduct of judgment 
        evading foreign states and their domestic corporations, and 
        motivate such states and corporations to raise their standards 
        of behavior.
            (8) An effective means of achieving this important 
        objective without impinging on the President's freedom to act 
        in the foreign policy arena is to deprive judgment evading 
        foreign states and their domestic corporations of the privilege 
        of raising capital in the United States until those states 
        demonstrate that such measures are no longer necessary by 
        satisfying all outstanding judgments of the United States 
        courts.

                one or more corporations or entities that is organized 
                under the laws of a judgment evading foreign state.
            (3) Final judgment.--The term ``final judgment'' means any

        settings for the full compensation and fair treatment of United 
        States citizens and other persons in whose favor judgments have 
        been awarded by the United States courts;
            (2) to seek to protect the economic interests of United 
        States taxpayers by restricting the access to the United States 
        capital markets of judgment evading foreign states, and 
        subjecting to Congressional scrutiny requests for aid made by 
        judgment evading foreign states to the United States 
        Government;
            (3) to seek to protect the authority of the United States

measures to deny every judgment evading foreign state access to United 
States capital markets, including the ability, directly or indirectly, 
to borrow or sell securities in the United States unless the proceeds

satisfy in full all final judgments that form the basis for that 
foreign state's designation as a judgment evading foreign state. If any 
judgment evading foreign state remains in default on any such final 
judgment for more than 2 years, the Securities and Exchange Commission 
shall take all measures to deny any domestic corporation of a judgment 
evading foreign state access to the United States capital markets.

        foreign state;
            (2) quantifying the impact on the United States economy,

The final rule must be issued 3 years after the issuance of a proposed rule, which must be created within 18 months of the issuance of the interim final standard.","SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Worker Protection Against 
Combustible Dust Explosions and Fires Act of 2011''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) An emergency exists concerning worker exposure to 
        combustible dust explosions and fires, and there is a 
        significant risk of death or severe injury to workers employed 
        at facilities where combustible dusts are present.
            (2) Following 3 catastrophic dust explosions that killed 14 
        workers in 2003, the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation 
        Board (CSB) issued a report in November 2006, which identified 
        281 combustible dust incidents between 1980 and 2005 that 
        killed 119 workers and injured 718. The CSB concluded that 
        ``combustible dust explosions are a serious hazard in American 
        industry''. A quarter of the explosions occurred at food 
        industry facilities, including sugar plants.
            (3) In November 2006, the CSB recommended that the 
        Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) issue a 
        standard designed to prevent combustible dust fires and 
        explosions in general industry, based on current National Fire 
        Protection Association (NFPA) dust explosion standards.
            (4) Fourteen workers were killed and more than 38 seriously 
        injured in a catastrophic combustible dust explosion at 
        Imperial Sugar in Port Wentworth, Georgia on February 7, 2008.
            (5) An investigation by the CSB found that the explosion at 
        Imperial Sugar was fueled by a massive accumulation of sugar 
        dust throughout the packaging building, triggering a series of 
        secondary explosions throughout the factory.
            (6) The CSB's final report of September 24, 2009, regarding 
        the Imperial Sugar Refinery explosion reiterated its previous 
        recommendation from November 2006 that OSHA proceed 
        expeditiously ``to promulgate a comprehensive standard to 
        reduce or eliminate hazards from fire and explosion from 
        combustible powders and dust''.
            (7) Explosions continue to injure workers and cause 
        property damage. In the 3 years since the February 7, 2008, 
        explosion at Imperial Sugar, there have been 24 additional 
        combustible dust explosions or fires resulting in 4 deaths and 
        65 injuries to workers through February 7, 2011, according to 
        data released by the Chemical Safety Board.
            (8) On October 21, 2009, OSHA issued an advance notice of 
        proposed rulemaking in response to the CSB's recommendation; 
        however, a final rule will take at least 4 more years, during 
        which it is foreseeable that additional workers will be 
        seriously injured or killed.
            (9) OSHA issued a grain handling facilities standard (29 
        C.F.R. 1910.272) in 1987 that has proven highly effective in 
        reducing the risk of combustible grain dust explosions, 
        according to an OSHA evaluation.
            (10) No OSHA standard comprehensively addresses combustible 
        dust explosion hazards in general industry.
            (11) Voluntary NFPA standards exist that, when implemented, 
        effectively reduce the likelihood and impact of combustible 
        dust explosions. In particular--
                    (A) certain requirements currently apply to 
                existing establishments, which NFPA refers to as a 
                ``retroactive'' application, and include hazard 
                assessment, housekeeping, control of static 
                electricity, control of open flames and sparks, use of 
                certain tools, employee training, and requirements for 
                inspection and maintenance of equipment;
                    (B) other requirements include conventional 
                ignition source control and dust emission control 
                technologies, such as ventilation systems that capture 
                fugitive dust, and enclosure of dust generating 
                processes;
                    (C) many employers currently implement such 
                requirements from NFPA standards to address combustible 
                dust hazards in the workplace; and
                    (D) many employers maintain written combustible 
                dust safety programs and involve employees in 
                implementing the program, which are important aspects 
                of a comprehensive combustible dust hazard control 
                system.
            (12) Implementation of such means of hazard control is both 
        technologically and economically feasible and would 
        substantially reduce risks related to combustible dust fires 
        and explosions to workers.

SEC. 3. ISSUANCE OF INTERIM STANDARD ON COMBUSTIBLE DUST.

    (a) Application and Rulemaking.--Not later than 1 year after the 
date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Labor shall promulgate 
an interim final standard regulating occupational exposure to

        systems and filters.
            (4) Requirements for workplace inspection and housekeeping 
        to prevent accumulation of combustible dust in places of 
        employment in such depths that it can present explosion, 
        deflagration, or other fire hazards, including safe methods of 
        dust removal.
            (5) Requirements for participation of employees and their 
        representatives in hazard assessment, development of and 
        compliance with the written program, incident investigation, 
        and other elements of hazard management.
            (6) Requirements to provide written safety and health 
        information and annual training to managers and employees and 
        their representatives, including housekeeping procedures, hot 
        work procedures, preventive, predictive, and periodic 
        maintenance procedures, common ignition sources, and lock-out, 
        tag-out procedures.
    (d) Applicability of Other Statutory Requirements.--The 
requirements applicable to occupational safety and health standards 
under section 6(b) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 
(29 U.S.C. 655(b)), the requirements of chapters 5 and 6 of title 5, 
United States Code, and titles 2 and 42, United States Code, shall not 
apply to the issuance of the interim final standard required under this 
section.
    (e) Effective Date of Interim Standard.--The interim final standard 
shall take effect 30 days after issuance, except that such standard may 
include a reasonable phase-in period for implementation of required 
engineering controls. The interim final standard shall have the legal 
effect of an occupational safety and health standard, and shall apply 
until a final standard becomes effective under section 6 of the 
Occupational Safety and Health Act (29 U.S.C. 655).

SEC. 4. FINAL STANDARD ON COMBUSTIBLE DUST.

    Not later than 18 months after the date on which the interim final 
standard is issued under section 3, the Secretary of Labor shall, 
pursuant to section 6 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (29 
U.S.C. 655), issue a proposed rule for regulating combustible dust 
explosions that includes the major elements contained in the interim 
final standard issued under section 3, and shall issue a final rule 3 
years after the issuance of a proposed rule.",billsum_generic,GPT 3.5,,factual,factual,,,,,,,,

        reclaiming abandoned uranium mines on Federal lands in 
        accordance with the priorities and eligibility restrictions, 
        respectively, under subsections (c) and (d) of section 411 of 
        the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (30

        an exploration license. No person may conduct uranium 
        exploration for commercial purposes on lands subject to this 
        Act without such an exploration license. Each exploration 
        license shall be for a term of not more than two years and 
        shall be subject to a reasonable fee. An exploration license 
        shall confer no right to a lease under this Act. The issuance 
        of exploration licenses shall not preclude the Secretary from 
        issuing uranium leases at such times and locations and to such 
        persons as the Secretary deems appropriate. No exploration 
        license may be issued for any land on which a uranium lease has 
        been issued. A separate exploration license shall be required 
        for exploration in each State. An application for an 
        exploration license shall identify general areas and probable 
        methods of exploration. Each exploration license shall be 
        limited to specific geographic areas in each State as 
        determined by the Secretary, and shall contain such reasonable 
        conditions as the Secretary may require, including conditions 
        to ensure the protection of the environment, and shall be 
        subject to all applicable Federal, State, and local laws and 
        regulations. Upon violation of any such conditions or laws the 
        Secretary may revoke the exploration license.
            ``(2) Limitations.--A licensee may not cause substantial 
        disturbance to the natural land surface. A licensee may not 
        remove any uranium for sale but may remove a reasonable amount 
        of uranium from the lands subject to this Act included under 
        the Secretary's license for analysis and study. A licensee must 
        comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the Federal 
        agency having jurisdiction over the surface of the lands 
        subject to this Act. Exploration licenses covering lands the 
        surface of which is under the jurisdiction of any Federal 
        agency other than the Department of the Interior may be issued 
        only upon such conditions as it may prescribe with respect to 
        the use and protection of the nonmineral interests in those 
        lands.

        Secretary copies of all data (including geological, 
        geophysical, and core drilling analyses) obtained during such 
        exploration. The Secretary shall maintain the confidentiality 
        of all data so obtained until after the areas involved have 
        been leased or until such time as the Secretary determines that 
        making the data available to the public would not damage the 
        competitive position of the licensee, whichever comes first.

        willfully conducts uranium exploration for commercial purposes 
        on lands subject to this Act without an exploration license 
        issued under this subsection shall be subject to a fine of not 
        more than $1,000 for each day of violation. All data collected 
        by such person on any Federal lands as a result of such 
        violation shall be made immediately available to the Secretary, 
        who shall make the data available to the public as soon as it 
        is practicable. No penalty under this subsection shall be 
        assessed unless such person is given notice and opportunity for 
        a hearing with respect to such violation.
    ``(j) Conversion of Mining Claims to Mineral Leases.--
            ``(1) In general.--The owner of any mining claim (in this 
        subsection referred to as a `claimant') located prior to the 
        date of enactment of this section may, within two years after 
        such date, apply to the Secretary of the Interior to convert 
        the claim to a lease under this section. The Secretary shall 
        issue a uranium lease under this section to the claimant upon a 
        demonstration by the claimant, to the satisfaction of the 
        Secretary, within one year after the date of the application to 
        the Secretary, that the claim was, as of such date of 
        enactment, supported by the discovery of a valuable deposit of 
        uranium on the claimed land. The holder of a lease issued upon 
        conversion from a mining claim under this subsection shall be 
        subject to all the requirements of this section governing 
        uranium leases, except that the holder shall pay a royalty of 
        6.25 percent on the value of the uranium produced under the 
        lease, until beginning ten years after the date the claim is 
        converted to a lease.

        for uranium on Federal lands whose claimant does not apply to 
        the Secretary for conversion to a lease, or whose claimant

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Oil Region of Northwestern Pennsylvania, with 
        numerous sites and districts listed on the National Register of 
        Historic Places, and designated by the Governor of Pennsylvania 
        as one of the State Heritage Park Areas, is a region with 
        tremendous physical and natural resources and possesses a story 
        of State, national, and international significance.
            (2) The single event of Colonel Edwin Drake's drilling of 
        the world's first successful oil well in 1859 has affected the 
        industrial, natural, social, and political structures of the 
        modern world.
            (3) Six national historic districts are located within the 
        State Heritage Park boundary, in Emlenton, Franklin, Oil City, 
        and Titusville, as well as 17 separate National Register sites.
            (4) The Allegheny River, which was designated as a 
        component of the national wild and scenic rivers system in 1992 
        by Public Law 102-271, traverses the Oil Region and connects 
        several of its major sites, as do some of the river's 
        tributaries such as Oil Creek, French Creek, and Sandy Creek.
            (5) The unspoiled rural character of the Oil Region 
        provides many natural and recreational resources, scenic 
        vistas, and excellent water quality for people throughout the 
        United States to enjoy.
            (6) Remnants of the oil industry, visible on the landscape 
        to this day, provide a direct link to the past for visitors, as 
        do the historic valley settlements, riverbed settlements, 
        plateau developments, farmlands, and industrial landscapes.
            (7) The Oil Region also represents a cross section of 
        American history associated with Native Americans, frontier 
        settlements, the French and Indian War, African Americans and 
        the Underground Railroad, and immigration of Swedish and Polish 
        individuals, among others.
            (8) Involvement by the Federal Government shall serve to 
        enhance the efforts of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, local 
        subdivisions of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, volunteer

        national, and recreational resources of the region in order to 
        fulfill their full potential.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to enhance a cooperative 
management framework to assist the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, its 
units of local government, and area citizens in conserving, enhancing, 
and interpreting the significant features of the lands, water, and 
structures of the Oil Region, in a manner consistent with compatible 
economic development for the benefit and inspiration of present and 
future generations in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the United 
States.

        numerous sites and districts listed on the National Register of 
        Historic Places, and designated by the Governor of Pennsylvania 
        as one of the State Heritage Park Areas, is a region with 
        tremendous physical and natural resources and possesses a story 
        of State, national, and international significance.
            (2) The single event of Colonel Edwin Drake's drilling of 
        the world's first successful oil well in 1859 has affected the 
        industrial, natural, social, and political structures of the 
        modern world.
            (3) Six national historic districts are located within the 
        State Heritage Park boundary, in Emlenton, Franklin, Oil City, 
        and Titusville, as well as 17 separate National Register sites.

        component of the national wild and scenic rivers system in 1992 
        by Public Law 102-271, traverses the Oil Region and connects 
        several of its major sites, as do some of the river's 
        tributaries such as Oil Creek, French Creek, and Sandy Creek.
            (5) The unspoiled rural character of the Oil Region 
        provides many natural and recreational resources, scenic 
        vistas, and excellent water quality for people throughout the 
        United States to enjoy.
            (6) Remnants of the oil industry, visible on the landscape 
        to this day, provide a direct link to the past for visitors, as 
        do the historic valley settlements, riverbed settlements, 
        plateau developments, farmlands, and industrial landscapes.
            (7) The Oil Region also represents a cross section of 
        American history associated with Native Americans, frontier 
        settlements, the French and Indian War, African Americans and 
        the Underground Railroad, and immigration of Swedish and Polish 
        individuals, among others.

        modern world.
            (3) Six national historic districts are located within the 
        State Heritage Park boundary, in Emlenton, Franklin, Oil City, 
        and Titusville, as well as 17 separate National Register sites.
            (4) The Allegheny River, which was designated as a 
        component of the national wild and scenic rivers system in 1992 
        by Public Law 102-271, traverses the Oil Region and connects 
        several of its major sites, as do some of the river's 
        tributaries such as Oil Creek, French Creek, and Sandy Creek.
            (5) The unspoiled rural character of the Oil Region 
        provides many natural and recreational resources, scenic 
        vistas, and excellent water quality for people throughout the 
        United States to enjoy.
            (6) Remnants of the oil industry, visible on the landscape 
        to this day, provide a direct link to the past for visitors, as 
        do the historic valley settlements, riverbed settlements, 
        plateau developments, farmlands, and industrial landscapes.
            (7) The Oil Region also represents a cross section of 
        American history associated with Native Americans, frontier 
        settlements, the French and Indian War, African Americans and 
        the Underground Railroad, and immigration of Swedish and Polish 
        individuals, among others.
            (8) Involvement by the Federal Government shall serve to 
        enhance the efforts of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, local 
        subdivisions of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, volunteer 
        organizations, and private businesses, to promote the cultural, 
        national, and recreational resources of the region in order to 
        fulfill their full potential.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to enhance a cooperative 
management framework to assist the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, its 
units of local government, and area citizens in conserving, enhancing, 
and interpreting the significant features of the lands, water, and 
structures of the Oil Region, in a manner consistent with compatible 
economic development for the benefit and inspiration of present and 
future generations in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the United

38,6694e66e-fff8-40d1-9805-8174f3e09208_gpt3_gen,"The Electronic Commerce Extension Establishment Act of 1999 was created to establish an electronic commerce extension program for small businesses at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The legislation aimed to help small businesses participate in the electronic commerce revolution by identifying, adapting, and adopting electronic commerce technologies and practices. The program would be established through Regional Centers for the Transfer of Electronic Commerce Technology, which would be affiliated with United States-based nonprofit institutions or organizations. The program would provide financial assistance to these Centers and require them to enhance productivity and technological performance in the United States electronic commerce through training, education, and technology transfer activities. The text includes provisions for the program's establishment, operation, evaluation, and funding. The Secretary of Commerce must publish a proposal for the program, establish criteria for choosing recipients of financial assistance, and authorize appropriations as required each fiscal year.","SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Electronic Commerce Extension 
Establishment Act of 1999''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The United States economy is in the early stages of a 
        revolution in electronic commerce--the ability to buy, sell, 
        and even deliver goods and services through computer networks. 
        Estimates are that electronic commerce sales in 1998 were 
        around $100,000,000,000 and could rise to $1,300,000,000,000 by 
        2003.
            (2) Electronic commerce promises to spur tremendously 
        United States productivity and economic growth--repeating a 
        historical pattern where the greatest impetus toward economic 
        growth lies not in the sale of new technologies but in their 
        widespread adoption and use.
            (3) Electronic commerce presents an enormous opportunity 
        and challenge for small businesses. Such commerce will give 
        such businesses new markets and new ways of doing businesses. 
        However, many such business will have difficulty in adopting 
        appropriate electronic commerce technologies and practices. 
        Moreover, such businesses in more rural areas will find distant 
        businesses entering their markets and competing with them. 
        Thus, there is considerable risk many small businesses will be 
        left behind in the shift to electronic commerce.
            (4) The United States has an interest in ensuring that 
        small businesses in all parts of the United States participate 
        fully in the electronic commerce revolution, both for the sake 
        of such businesses and in order to promote productivity and 
        economic growth throughout the entire United States economy.
            (5) The Federal Government has a long history of 
        successfully helping small farmers with new agricultural 
        technologies through the Cooperative Extension System at the 
        Department of Agriculture, founded in 1914. More recently, the 
        National Institute of Standards and Technology has successfully 
        helped small manufacturers with manufacturing technologies 
        through its Manufacturing Extension Program, established in 
        1988.
            (6) Similarly, now is the time to establish an electronic 
        commerce extension program to help small businesses throughout 
        the United States identify, adapt, and adopt electronic 
        commerce technologies and business practices, thereby ensuring 
        that such businesses fully participate in the electronic 
        commerce revolution.

SEC. 3. PURPOSE.

    The purpose of this Act is to establish an electronic commerce 
extension program focused on small businesses at the National Institute 
of Standards and Technology.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The United States economy is in the early stages of a 
        revolution in electronic commerce--the ability to buy, sell, 
        and even deliver goods and services through computer networks. 
        Estimates are that electronic commerce sales in 1998 were 
        around $100,000,000,000 and could rise to $1,300,000,000,000 by 
        2003.
            (2) Electronic commerce promises to spur tremendously 
        United States productivity and economic growth--repeating a 
        historical pattern where the greatest impetus toward economic 
        growth lies not in the sale of new technologies but in their 
        widespread adoption and use.
            (3) Electronic commerce presents an enormous opportunity 
        and challenge for small businesses. Such commerce will give 
        such businesses new markets and new ways of doing businesses. 
        However, many such business will have difficulty in adopting 
        appropriate electronic commerce technologies and practices. 
        Moreover, such businesses in more rural areas will find distant 
        businesses entering their markets and competing with them. 
        Thus, there is considerable risk many small businesses will be 
        left behind in the shift to electronic commerce.
            (4) The United States has an interest in ensuring that 
        small businesses in all parts of the United States participate 
        fully in the electronic commerce revolution, both for the sake 
        of such businesses and in order to promote productivity and 
        economic growth throughout the entire United States economy.
            (5) The Federal Government has a long history of 
        successfully helping small farmers with new agricultural 
        technologies through the Cooperative Extension System at the 
        Department of Agriculture, founded in 1914. More recently, the 
        National Institute of Standards and Technology has successfully 
        helped small manufacturers with manufacturing technologies 
        through its Manufacturing Extension Program, established in 
        1988.
            (6) Similarly, now is the time to establish an electronic 
        commerce extension program to help small businesses throughout 
        the United States identify, adapt, and adopt electronic 
        commerce technologies and business practices, thereby ensuring 
        that such businesses fully participate in the electronic 
        commerce revolution.

SEC. 3. PURPOSE.

    The purpose of this Act is to establish an electronic commerce 
extension program focused on small businesses at the National Institute 
of Standards and Technology.

        dated by the consumer, which contains the declaration that the 
        purchaser has received the disclosure required under this

        accepted, extensions of credit are granted or insured products

SHORT TITLE.

    This Act shall be known as the ``Skill Game Protection Act''.

SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Millions of Americans enjoy competing with other 
        players in a variety of games of skill, including bridge, mah-
        jong, backgammon, and poker, over the Internet, where the 
        operator provides the Internet venue for competition and 
        receives a fee for such service.
            (2) For some Americans, these games provide their primary 
        source of income.
            (3) While each of these games contains an element of 
        chance, over any substantial interval, a player's success at 
        any of these games is determined by that player's relative 
        level of skill and is widely recognized as such.
            (4) Games where success is predominantly determined by the 
        skill of the players involved, as a matter of law and of 
        policy, are distinct from the games of chance traditionally 
        described and addressed in Federal and State gambling statutes.
            (5) Despite the fact that the language in section 1084 of 
        title 18, United States Code, commonly referred to as the 
        ``Wire Act'', has been interpreted by Federal courts as 
        applying only to betting on sports, some in law enforcement 
        interpret the section as prohibiting the acceptance of both 
        sports and non-sports betting through a communications device.
            (6) The Federal Government should take appropriate steps to 
        ensure that, with respect to skill games--
                    (A) minors are prevented from playing for money;
                    (B) persons with compulsive behavior should be 
                identified and referred to treatment;
                    (C) operators of such games should not be 
                vulnerable to, or participate in criminal or terrorist 
                money laundering; and
                    (D) appropriate taxes are collected.

SEC. 3. CLARIFICATION.

    Section 1084 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by adding 
at the end the following new subsection: (f)
    ``(f) As used in this section, the term `bets or wagers' does not 
include operating, or participation in, poker, chess, bridge, mahjong 
or any other game where success is predominantly determined by a 
player's skill, to the extent that--
            ``(1) the game provides for competition only between and 
        among participants, and not against the person operating the 
        game; and
            ``(2) the operator is in compliance with regulations issued 
        pursuant to section 5368 of title 31, United States Code.''.

        in which the individual participates at the time in the 
        individual participates.
            ``(3) Appropriate mechanisms to ensure that all taxes 
        relating to Internet games of skill due to Federal and State 
        governments and to Indian tribes from individual participants 
        are collected as required by at the time of any payment of any 
        proceeds of Internet games of skill.
            ``(4) Appropriate safeguards to combat fraud and money 
        laundering as may be prescribed by regulations issued by the 
        Secretary or a designee of the Secretary.
            ``(5) Appropriate safeguards to combat compulsive

    This Act shall be known as the ``Skill Game Protection Act''.

SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Millions of Americans enjoy competing with other 
        players in a variety of games of skill, including bridge, mah-
        jong, backgammon, and poker, over the Internet, where the 
        operator provides the Internet venue for competition and 
        receives a fee for such service.
            (2) For some Americans, these games provide their primary 
        source of income.
            (3) While each of these games contains an element of 
        chance, over any substantial interval, a player's success at 
        any of these games is determined by that player's relative 
        level of skill and is widely recognized as such.
            (4) Games where success is predominantly determined by the 
        skill of the players involved, as a matter of law and of 
        policy, are distinct from the games of chance traditionally 
        described and addressed in Federal and State gambling statutes.
            (5) Despite the fact that the language in section 1084 of 
        title 18, United States Code, commonly referred to as the 
        ``Wire Act'', has been interpreted by Federal courts as 
        applying only to betting on sports, some in law enforcement 
        interpret the section as prohibiting the acceptance of both 
        sports and non-sports betting through a communications device.
            (6) The Federal Government should take appropriate steps to 
        ensure that, with respect to skill games--
                    (A) minors are prevented from playing for money;
                    (B) persons with compulsive behavior should be 
                identified and referred to treatment;
                    (C) operators of such games should not be 
                vulnerable to, or participate in criminal or terrorist 
                money laundering; and
                    (D) appropriate taxes are collected.

(d), and (e) of this section, trade dress which functions as a mark may 
be registered and protected without the need to show that it has become 
distinctive under subsection (f) of this section if the relevant public 
is likely to identify the source of the product or service by reference 
to the subject matter claimed as trade dress. In determining whether 
the relevant public is likely to identify the source of the product or 
service by reference to the subject matter claimed as trade dress, the 
factors to be considered shall include, but not be limited to--
            ``(1) whether the trade dress is unique or unusual in the

        particular class of goods or services viewed by the public as a 
        dress or ornamentation for the goods or services; and

register, a mark may consist of any symbol, name, word, slogan, phrase, 
surname, geographical name, numeral, device, color, label, any matter 
that is not functional, or any combination of any of the foregoing, but 
such mark must be capable of distinguishing the applicant's goods or 
services.''.

appearance of a product or service, including, but not limited to, the 
design of packaging, labels, containers, displays, decor, color, the 
design of a product, a product feature, or a combination of product 
features, except that trade dress shall not be registered or protected 
under this Act if it is functional.
    ``The term `functional' means, with respect to matter sought to be 
protected under this Act, that the matter is of such superior design 
for its purpose that to afford it protection under this Act would 
significantly hinder effective competition. In determining whether 
matter sought to be protected under this Act is functional, the factors 
to be considered shall include, but not be limited to--
            ``(1) whether the matter yields a competitive advantage;
            ``(2) whether alternative designs are available; and
            ``(3) whether the matter achieves economies in the 
        manufacture or use of the goods or services, or affects their

mark, or certification mark.''.

for trade dress not registered on the principal register, the person 
who asserts trade dress protection has the burden of proving that the

        evidence to the Secretary of Health and Human Services or the 
        Secretary of Commerce from a laboratory accredited under 
        section 422 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21

                    (A) each prior shipment whose appearance triggered 
                the application of such paragraph was in fact in 
                compliance with the provisions of subsection (a) and 
                other applicable Federal laws or regulations, including 
                those prohibiting seafood fraud; or
                    (B) during the preceding 12 months, no shipment of 
                seafood originating from the exporter has triggered the 
                application of paragraph (1).
    (c) Penalties.--The Secretary of Commerce shall prevent any person 
from violating this Act, or any Act to which this section applies, in 
the same manner, by the same means, and with the same jurisdiction, 
powers, and duties as though sections 308 through 311 of the Magnuson-
Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1858 through

the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall--
            (1) increase, as resources allow, the number of foreign and 
        domestic seafood shipments that are inspected for seafood fraud 
        by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration inspectors 
        and authorized officers, including verification of compliance 
        with the traceability requirements of subsection (a);
            (2) ensure that the percentage of seafood shipments 
        inspected during a given year is not lower than the percentage 
        inspected during the previous year; and
            (3) to the maximum extent practicable, ensure that 
        inspections and tests for seafood fraud prevention also collect 
        information to support the Secretary of Health and Human 
        Services in implementing the seafood safety requirements of the 
        FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (Public Law 111-353).
    (f) Impact on Existing Food Safety Authority.--Nothing in this 
section shall be construed to limit the authority of the Secretary of

SEC. 4. AUTHORITY OF STATES.

    Whenever the attorney general of a State, or an official or agency 
designated by a State, has reason to believe that any person has 
engaged or is engaging in a pattern or practice of seafood fraud in 
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of section 3, the State may bring a 
civil action on behalf of its residents to enjoin fraud, an action to 
recover for actual monetary loss or receive $10,000 in damages for each 
violation, or both such actions. If the court finds the defendant 
willfully or knowingly violated this Act, the court may, in its 
discretion, increase the amount of the award to an amount equal to not 
more than 3 times the amount available under the preceding sentence. 
Nothing in this section shall preclude an individual from bringing a 
civil action.

SEC. 5. PREEMPTION.

    Nothing in this Act preempts the authority of a State to establish 
and enforce requirements for improving seafood safety and preventing 
seafood fraud that are consistent with the requirements of this Act.

The first amendment is a rent reasonableness test that requires public housing agencies to ensure that the rent charged for each assisted unit is reasonable compared to rents for comparable unassisted units in the private residential rental market. The ownership limitation amendment prohibits a single public housing agency from providing tenant-based assistance under Section 8 for more than five dwelling units owned by any single owner, with certain exceptions. The rent paid by assisted families amendment clarifies the rent payment rules for both the Housing Certificate Program and Housing Voucher Program. Families assisted under these programs may pay for rent more than the amount determined under the Section 3(a)(1) rule. Instead, families must pay the greater of two amounts. The first amount is determined under Section 3(a)(1), and the second amount is the amount determined based on the maximum monthly rent under the contract.","SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

        by families assisted under such program.
If an agency determines that the rent (or rent increase) for a unit is 
not reasonable, the agency shall disapprove a lease for such unit.
    ``(ii) For purposes of this subparagraph, rent comparisons shall be 
conducted by comparing the rent of the assisted dwelling unit with the 
rent of comparable unassisted units that are located in a geographical 
area, determined by the agency and approved by the Secretary that--

The studies investigate the possible targeting of these groups through advertising and promotions, such as the use of themes, graphics, and techniques. They also examine the use of messages concerning weight loss and weight maintenance, low yield tobacco products, and demographics of targeted audiences. The findings of these studies are to be reported to Congress, along with any necessary legislative actions to address the issue. The act is based on Congress' findings that tobacco advertising may encourage the uptake of smoking among young people, women, and minorities, and that tobacco-related diseases disproportionately affect these groups.","SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Tobacco Advertising and Promotion 
Studies Act of 1994''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    (a) Advertising.--The Congress makes the following findings 
respecting advertising of tobacco products:
            (1) The tobacco industry spends over $4 billion annually to 
        advertise and promote cigarette products.
            (2) Since 1964, the tobacco industry has had a voluntary 
        advertising code which it claims was implemented to 
        sufficiently ensure against children and teenagers being 
        encouraged to smoke cigarettes and which, according to the 
        tobacco industry, prohibits the advertising of cigarette 
        products from making implied or direct health claims.
            (3) The voluntary advertising code which the tobacco 
        industry claims is a sufficient safeguard against improper 
        advertising and marketing practices recommends that cigarette 
        advertising shall not suggest that cigarette smoking is 
        ``essential'' to sexual attraction, success, sophistication, or 
        good health and that models in cigarette advertisements shall 
        be at least 25 years of age and shall not be made to appear 
        under such age.
            (4) Despite the existence of, and alleged compliance by the 
        tobacco industry with, the voluntary advertising code, a number 
        of studies have shown that cigarette advertising may be an 
        important factor in encouraging youth, women, and minorities to 
        take up the cigarette smoking habit and may reinforce decisions 
        to continue to smoke.
    (b) Women.--The Congress makes the following findings respecting 
women and tobacco:
            (1) The fastest growing sector of smokers in the United 
        States are women under the age of 23. Approximately 2,000 girls 
        and young women smoke their first cigarette every day.
            (2) It is expected that between the years 2005 and 2010, 
        the number of women dying from smoking related diseases will 
        exceed the number of men so dying.
            (3) Each year tobacco kills more than 147,000 women in the 
        United States, mostly through cigarette smoking induced heart 
        disease, lung cancer, and other lung diseases.
            (4) As smoking by women has increased, lung cancer in women 
        has skyrocketed. In 1987 lung cancer surpassed breast cancer as 
        the leading cancer killer of women.
            (5) Women who smoke as little as 1 to 4 cigarettes each day 
        increase their risk of heart attack by 2 to 3 times.
            (6) In 1991 for the first time in more than a decade the 
        prevalence of smoking among women actually increased rather 
        than decreased.
            (7) Women who smoke cigarettes during pregnancy increase 
        the risk for low birth weight and premature infants, 
        miscarriage, stillbirths, sudden infant death syndrome, and 
        infant mortality.
            (8) Pregnant women who smoke deliver babies an average of 
        one-half inch shorter and 7 ounces lighter than the babies of 
        nonsmoking mothers. There is a 25 to 50 percent higher rate of 
        fetal and infant death among women who smoke during pregnancy 
        compared with those who do not smoke. It is estimated that 
        4,000 infants die each year because of their mother's smoking.
            (9) Approximately 44 percent of all women who currently 
        smoke have attempted to quit smoking in the past year.
            (10) Cigarette smoking increases women's risk of 
        contracting cervical cancer.
    (c) Minorities.--The Congress makes the following findings 
respecting minorities and tobacco:
            (1) Tobacco use by African-Americans is responsible for 
        nearly 48,000 deaths each year in the United States.
            (2) Tobacco companies aggressively target members of the 
        African-American community and the growing Hispanic population, 
        particularly in the urban, inner-city environment.
            (3) As of 1991, 29.2 percent of African-American adults 
        (aged 18 and older) smoked cigarettes, including 35.1 percent 
        of African-American men and 24.4 percent of African-American 
        women.
            (4) As of 1991, 16 percent of Asian/Pacific Islander adults 
        (aged 18 and older) smoked cigarettes, including 24.2 percent 
        of Asian/Pacific Islander men and 7.5 percent of Asian/Pacific 
        Islander women.
            (5) As of 1991, 31.4 percent of American Indian/Alaskan 
        Natives adults (aged 18 and older) smoked cigarettes, including 
        27.9 percent of American Indian/Alaskan Natives men and 35.2 
        percent of American Indian/Alaskan Natives women.
            (6) As of 1991, 20.2 percent of Hispanic adults (aged 18 
        and older) smoked cigarettes, including 25.2 percent of 
        Hispanic men and 15.5 percent of Hispanic women.
            (7) African Americans suffer from tobacco-related disease 
        at a higher rate than whites, including a higher incidence of 
        respiratory system, esophagus, and oral cavity cancers.
            (8) Lung cancer is increasing among Hispanic men.

SEC. 3. TOBACCO ADVERTISING STUDIES.

    (a) Studies.--The Federal Trade Commission shall conduct the 
following studies which should be based on existing studies and on 
significant original market research:
            (1) Women and minorities.--A study of current tobacco 
        advertising to determine--
                    (A) if and in what forms such advertising and 
                promotion uses themes, graphics, and techniques which 
                are likely to appeal specifically to (i) girls and 
                women and (ii) minorities in ways that make smoking 
                attractive to them, and
                    (B) whether targeting girls, women, and minorities 
                increases tobacco use.
        In connection with such study, advertising of alcoholic 
        beverages shall be reviewed to determine the extent to which 
        such advertising targets girls and women and minorities.
            (2) Weight loss and maintenance.--
                    (A) In general.--A study of current cigarette 
                advertising and promotion to investigate the targeting 
                of girls and women in cigarette advertising and 
                promotion and tobacco companies' use of messages in 
                their advertising and promotion, explicitly or 
                implicitly, concerning weight loss and weight 
                maintenance, the wording and overall imagery used in 
                such advertising and promotion and its impact on girls 
                and women, and the perception of girls and women, 
                including smokers and non-smokers, of the relation 
                between the use of tobacco and weight control and 
                maintenance.
                    (B) Terms and imagery.--In conducting the study 
                under subparagraph (A), the Federal Trade Commission 
                shall examine the following:
                            (i) Whether women interpret the use of the 
                        terms ``slim'', ``light'', ``thin'', 
                        ``superslim'', and related terms and the shape 
                        of cigarettes employing such terms as implying 
                        that cigarette smoking results in weight loss 
                        or weight maintenance.
                            (ii) Whether girl's and women's 
                        interpretation of such terms and imagery 
                        accurately reflects the actual effect of 
                        cigarette smoking on weight. In particular, 
                        whether girls and women are knowledgeable about 
                        the transient and reversible nature of any 
                        smoking induced weight loss, the precise 
                        magnitude of weight loss which may be 
                        experienced upon the taking up of smoking, and 
                        the precise magnitude of weight gain which may 
                        be experienced upon smoking cessation.
                            (iii) The relative impact of cigarette 
                        smoking on the health of girls and women and 
                        whether or not girls and women are 
                        knowledgeable about the impact of smoking on 
                        their health.
                            (iv) Whether the Federal Trade Commission 
                        has authority to take action with respect to 
                        advertising and promotion using such terms and 
                        imagery.
                            (v) To the extent that the Federal Trade 
                        Commission does not have the authority to take 
                        needed action, what legislation is needed to 
                        enable the Commission to take action necessary 
                        to fully remedy the study's findings.
            (3) Low yield tobacco products.--
                    (A) In general.--A study of current cigarette 
                advertising and promotion to investigate the apparent 
                targeting of girls and women and tobacco companies use 
                of messages concerning so called low tar/low nicotine 
                cigarettes (hereafter in this paragraph referred to as 
                ``low yield cigarettes''). This shall include the 
                wording and overall imagery used in advertising and 
                promotion for low yield cigarettes and the impact of 
                such advertising and promotion on both male and female 
                user's perception of the relative risk of smoking such 
                cigarettes as opposed to the smoking of non low yield 
                cigarettes or quitting smoking.
                    (B) Terms.--In conducting the study under 
                subparagraph (A), the Federal Trade Commission shall 
                examine the following:
                            (i) Whether men and women tend to interpret 
                        messages and imagery used in the advertising 
                        and promotion of low yield cigarettes to 
                        indicate that smoking such cigarettes is less 
                        hazardous than smoking other cigarettes. The 
                        Commission shall look at consumer's perception 
                        of a wide range of health risks, including 
                        cardiovascular disease, lung and other cancers, 
                        pulmonary diseases, risks during pregnancy, 
                        risk of environmental tobacco smoke exposure to 
                        surrounding individuals, and other risks and 
                        attempt to quantify the degree of risk 
                        reduction perceived by the reasonable consumer. 
                        In addition, the Commission shall examine 
                        whether the perception of male and female 
                        smokers differ in this regard.
                            (ii) Whether men's and women's 
                        interpretation of the wording and imagery used 
                        in advertising and promotion of low yield 
                        cigarettes, as determined under clause (i), 
                        accurately reflects the health hazards of 
                        cigarettes.
                            (iii) Whether men and women who smoke are 
                        likely to be influenced to smoke low yield 
                        cigarettes rather than quit smoking because of 
                        the advertising and promotion of such 
                        cigarettes. In this regard, the Commission 
                        shall examine whether smokers tend to differ 
                        according to whether or not they report being 
                        concerned about smoking's negative impact on 
                        their health and whether male and female 
                        smokers tend to differ from each other in this 
                        regard.
                            (iv) The relative likely impact of smoking 
                        of low yield cigarettes on men's and women's 
                        health relative to quitting smoking.
                            (v) Whether the Federal Trade Commission 
                        has the authority to take action with respect 
                        to advertising and promotion of low yield 
                        cigarettes.
                            (vi) To the extent that the Commission does 
                        not have the authority to take needed action, 
                        what legislation is needed to enable the 
                        Commission to take action necessary to fully 
                        remedy the study's findings.
            (4) Demographics.--
                    (A) In general.--A study of the demographics of 
                targeted audiences of cigarette advertising and 
                promotions which appear to be targeted at girls, women, 
                and minorities, including the age, gender, race, 
                ethnicity, and socio-economic groups of the girls, 
                women, and minorities and, in the case of minorities, 
                the demographics of such advertising and promotions for 
                smokeless tobacco products.
                    (B) Focus.--In conducting the study under 
                subparagraph (A), the Federal Trade Commission shall 
                identify--
                            (i) the media used to apparently target the 
                        groups described in subparagraph (A), including 
                        the types of publications used with their 
                        demographic profile, including the demographic 
                        profile of readers under the age of 18,
                            (ii) the types of promotions used, giving 
                        information about specific venues, and
                            (iii) the amount of money spent in each 
                        category.
    (b) Report.--The Federal Trade Commission shall complete each of 
the studies identified in subsection (a) not later than 9 months after 
the date of the enactment of this Act and shall, not later than 12 
months after such date, report to the Congress--
            (1) the results of such studies,
            (2) whether the Federal Trade Commission has the authority 
        to take action on the study's findings,
            (3) any actions the Commission proposes to take on the 
        basis of such findings, and
            (4) to the extent that the Commission does not have the

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    (a) Advertising.--The Congress makes the following findings 
respecting advertising of tobacco products:
            (1) The tobacco industry spends over $4 billion annually to 
        advertise and promote cigarette products.
            (2) Since 1964, the tobacco industry has had a voluntary 
        advertising code which it claims was implemented to 
        sufficiently ensure against children and teenagers being 
        encouraged to smoke cigarettes and which, according to the 
        tobacco industry, prohibits the advertising of cigarette 
        products from making implied or direct health claims.
            (3) The voluntary advertising code which the tobacco 
        industry claims is a sufficient safeguard against improper 
        advertising and marketing practices recommends that cigarette 
        advertising shall not suggest that cigarette smoking is 
        ``essential'' to sexual attraction, success, sophistication, or 
        good health and that models in cigarette advertisements shall 
        be at least 25 years of age and shall not be made to appear 
        under such age.
            (4) Despite the existence of, and alleged compliance by the 
        tobacco industry with, the voluntary advertising code, a number 
        of studies have shown that cigarette advertising may be an 
        important factor in encouraging youth, women, and minorities to 
        take up the cigarette smoking habit and may reinforce decisions 
        to continue to smoke.
    (b) Women.--The Congress makes the following findings respecting 
women and tobacco:
            (1) The fastest growing sector of smokers in the United 
        States are women under the age of 23. Approximately 2,000 girls 
        and young women smoke their first cigarette every day.
            (2) It is expected that between the years 2005 and 2010, 
        the number of women dying from smoking related diseases will 
        exceed the number of men so dying.
            (3) Each year tobacco kills more than 147,000 women in the 
        United States, mostly through cigarette smoking induced heart 
        disease, lung cancer, and other lung diseases.
            (4) As smoking by women has increased, lung cancer in women 
        has skyrocketed. In 1987 lung cancer surpassed breast cancer as 
        the leading cancer killer of women.
            (5) Women who smoke as little as 1 to 4 cigarettes each day 
        increase their risk of heart attack by 2 to 3 times.
            (6) In 1991 for the first time in more than a decade the 
        prevalence of smoking among women actually increased rather 
        than decreased.
            (7) Women who smoke cigarettes during pregnancy increase 
        the risk for low birth weight and premature infants, 
        miscarriage, stillbirths, sudden infant death syndrome, and 
        infant mortality.
            (8) Pregnant women who smoke deliver babies an average of 
        one-half inch shorter and 7 ounces lighter than the babies of 
        nonsmoking mothers. There is a 25 to 50 percent higher rate of 
        fetal and infant death among women who smoke during pregnancy 
        compared with those who do not smoke. It is estimated that 
        4,000 infants die each year because of their mother's smoking.
            (9) Approximately 44 percent of all women who currently 
        smoke have attempted to quit smoking in the past year.
            (10) Cigarette smoking increases women's risk of 
        contracting cervical cancer.
    (c) Minorities.--The Congress makes the following findings 
respecting minorities and tobacco:
            (1) Tobacco use by African-Americans is responsible for 
        nearly 48,000 deaths each year in the United States.
            (2) Tobacco companies aggressively target members of the 
        African-American community and the growing Hispanic population, 
        particularly in the urban, inner-city environment.
            (3) As of 1991, 29.2 percent of African-American adults 
        (aged 18 and older) smoked cigarettes, including 35.1 percent 
        of African-American men and 24.4 percent of African-American 
        women.
            (4) As of 1991, 16 percent of Asian/Pacific Islander adults 
        (aged 18 and older) smoked cigarettes, including 24.2 percent 
        of Asian/Pacific Islander men and 7.5 percent of Asian/Pacific 
        Islander women.
            (5) As of 1991, 31.4 percent of American Indian/Alaskan 
        Natives adults (aged 18 and older) smoked cigarettes, including 
        27.9 percent of American Indian/Alaskan Natives men and 35.2 
        percent of American Indian/Alaskan Natives women.
            (6) As of 1991, 20.2 percent of Hispanic adults (aged 18 
        and older) smoked cigarettes, including 25.2 percent of 
        Hispanic men and 15.5 percent of Hispanic women.
            (7) African Americans suffer from tobacco-related disease 
        at a higher rate than whites, including a higher incidence of 
        respiratory system, esophagus, and oral cavity cancers.
            (8) Lung cancer is increasing among Hispanic men.

SEC. 3. TOBACCO ADVERTISING STUDIES.

    (a) Studies.--The Federal Trade Commission shall conduct the 
following studies which should be based on existing studies and on 
significant original market research:
            (1) Women and minorities.--A study of current tobacco 
        advertising to determine--
                    (A) if and in what forms such advertising and 
                promotion uses themes, graphics, and techniques which 
                are likely to appeal specifically to (i) girls and 
                women and (ii) minorities in ways that make smoking 
                attractive to them, and
                    (B) whether targeting girls, women, and minorities 
                increases tobacco use.
        In connection with such study, advertising of alcoholic 
        beverages shall be reviewed to determine the extent to which 
        such advertising targets girls and women and minorities.
            (2) Weight loss and maintenance.--
                    (A) In general.--A study of current cigarette 
                advertising and promotion to investigate the targeting 
                of girls and women in cigarette advertising and 
                promotion and tobacco companies' use of messages in 
                their advertising and promotion, explicitly or 
                implicitly, concerning weight loss and weight 
                maintenance, the wording and overall imagery used in 
                such advertising and promotion and its impact on girls 
                and women, and the perception of girls and women, 
                including smokers and non-smokers, of the relation 
                between the use of tobacco and weight control and 
                maintenance.
                    (B) Terms and imagery.--In conducting the study 
                under subparagraph (A), the Federal Trade Commission 
                shall examine the following:
                            (i) Whether women interpret the use of the 
                        terms ``slim'', ``light'', ``thin'', 
                        ``superslim'', and related terms and the shape 
                        of cigarettes employing such terms as implying 
                        that cigarette smoking results in weight loss 
                        or weight maintenance.
                            (ii) Whether girl's and women's 
                        interpretation of such terms and imagery 
                        accurately reflects the actual effect of 
                        cigarette smoking on weight. In particular, 
                        whether girls and women are knowledgeable about 
                        the transient and reversible nature of any 
                        smoking induced weight loss, the precise 
                        magnitude of weight loss which may be 
                        experienced upon the taking up of smoking, and 
                        the precise magnitude of weight gain which may 
                        be experienced upon smoking cessation.
                            (iii) The relative impact of cigarette 
                        smoking on the health of girls and women and 
                        whether or not girls and women are 
                        knowledgeable about the impact of smoking on 
                        their health.
                            (iv) Whether the Federal Trade Commission 
                        has authority to take action with respect to 
                        advertising and promotion using such terms and 
                        imagery.
                            (v) To the extent that the Federal Trade 
                        Commission does not have the authority to take 
                        needed action, what legislation is needed to 
                        enable the Commission to take action necessary 
                        to fully remedy the study's findings.
            (3) Low yield tobacco products.--
                    (A) In general.--A study of current cigarette 
                advertising and promotion to investigate the apparent 
                targeting of girls and women and tobacco companies use 
                of messages concerning so called low tar/low nicotine 
                cigarettes (hereafter in this paragraph referred to as 
                ``low yield cigarettes''). This shall include the 
                wording and overall imagery used in advertising and 
                promotion for low yield cigarettes and the impact of 
                such advertising and promotion on both male and female 
                user's perception of the relative risk of smoking such 
                cigarettes as opposed to the smoking of non low yield 
                cigarettes or quitting smoking.
                    (B) Terms.--In conducting the study under 
                subparagraph (A), the Federal Trade Commission shall 
                examine the following:
                            (i) Whether men and women tend to interpret 
                        messages and imagery used in the advertising 
                        and promotion of low yield cigarettes to 
                        indicate that smoking such cigarettes is less 
                        hazardous than smoking other cigarettes. The 
                        Commission shall look at consumer's perception 
                        of a wide range of health risks, including 
                        cardiovascular disease, lung and other cancers, 
                        pulmonary diseases, risks during pregnancy, 
                        risk of environmental tobacco smoke exposure to 
                        surrounding individuals, and other risks and 
                        attempt to quantify the degree of risk 
                        reduction perceived by the reasonable consumer. 
                        In addition, the Commission shall examine 
                        whether the perception of male and female 
                        smokers differ in this regard.
                            (ii) Whether men's and women's 
                        interpretation of the wording and imagery used 
                        in advertising and promotion of low yield 
                        cigarettes, as determined under clause (i), 
                        accurately reflects the health hazards of 
                        cigarettes.
                            (iii) Whether men and women who smoke are 
                        likely to be influenced to smoke low yield 
                        cigarettes rather than quit smoking because of 
                        the advertising and promotion of such 
                        cigarettes. In this regard, the Commission 
                        shall examine whether smokers tend to differ 
                        according to whether or not they report being 
                        concerned about smoking's negative impact on 
                        their health and whether male and female 
                        smokers tend to differ from each other in this 
                        regard.
                            (iv) The relative likely impact of smoking 
                        of low yield cigarettes on men's and women's 
                        health relative to quitting smoking.
                            (v) Whether the Federal Trade Commission 
                        has the authority to take action with respect 
                        to advertising and promotion of low yield 
                        cigarettes.
                            (vi) To the extent that the Commission does 
                        not have the authority to take needed action, 
                        what legislation is needed to enable the 
                        Commission to take action necessary to fully 
                        remedy the study's findings.
            (4) Demographics.--
                    (A) In general.--A study of the demographics of 
                targeted audiences of cigarette advertising and 
                promotions which appear to be targeted at girls, women, 
                and minorities, including the age, gender, race, 
                ethnicity, and socio-economic groups of the girls,

                the demographics of such advertising and promotions for 
                smokeless tobacco products.
                    (B) Focus.--In conducting the study under 
                subparagraph (A), the Federal Trade Commission shall 
                identify--
                            (i) the media used to apparently target the 
                        groups described in subparagraph (A), including 
                        the types of publications used with their 
                        demographic profile, including the demographic 
                        profile of readers under the age of 18,
                            (ii) the types of promotions used, giving 
                        information about specific venues, and

                        category.
    (b) Report.--The Federal Trade Commission shall complete each of 
the studies identified in subsection (a) not later than 9 months after 
the date of the enactment of this Act and shall, not later than 12 
months after such date, report to the Congress--
            (1) the results of such studies,

            ``(1) The National Commission on Teaching and America's 
        Future reports that more than 12 percent of all newly hired 
        teachers enter the workforce with no training at all, and 
        another 15 percent enter the workforce without having fully met 
        State standards.
            ``(2) Annually, more than 50,000 people who lack the 
        training required for their jobs have entered teaching with 
        emergency or provisional licenses.
            ``(3) Only 500 of the Nation's 1,200 education schools meet 
        common professional standards.
            ``(4) Fewer than 75 percent of all teachers have studied 
        child development, and learning and teaching methods, have 
        degrees in their subject areas, and have passed State licensing

            ``(6) 64 percent of urban school districts allow teachers 
        who are not certified or licensed to teach under an emergency

It has been recognized that such attacks can be perpetrated by US citizens or residents against members of the Armed Forces. The changes will be retroactive effectively, and the relevant departments will review past events to determine whether or not they qualify.","SECTION 1. AWARD OF PURPLE HEART TO MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES KILLED 
              OR WOUNDED IN TERRORIST ATTACKS WITHIN THE UNITED STATES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Final Report of the National Commission on 
        Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (commonly known as the 
        ``9/11 Commission Report'') recognizes that there is a certain 
        ideology that gives rise to terrorism.
            (2) This ideology that gives rise to terrorism can even 
        influence citizens and residents of the United States to 
        perpetrate attacks within the United States against members of 
        the Armed Forces.
            (3) Two such attacks have already occurred within the 
        United States, one at a recruiting station in Little Rock, 
        Arkansas, on June 1, 2009, and one at Fort Hood, Texas, on 
        November 5, 2009.
            (4) According to investigative reports released by the 
        Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives 
        and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs 
        of the Senate at least 33 threats, plots, and strikes related 
        to domestic terrorism against United States military 
        communities have been uncovered since September 11, 2001.
            (5) These threats, plots, and strikes demonstrate that 
        members of the Armed Forces are at risk of terrorist attack not 
        only when deployed overseas, but also while stationed within 
        the United States.
            (6) The Department of Defense has recognized the threat 
        posed by terrorist attacks, including those perpetrated by a 
        member of the Armed Forces, by issuing revised regulations, 
        including Army Regulation 381-12 regarding the Military 
        Intelligence Threat Awareness and Reporting Program, to require 
        reporting of potential terrorist insider threat activity, 
        including when a member of the Armed Forces is ``advocating the 
        use of unlawful violence or force to achieve goals that are 
        political, religious, or ideological in nature''.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Secretary of Defense (and the Secretary of Homeland Security with 
respect to the Coast Guard) should duly honor those members of the 
Armed Forces who are killed or wounded in terrorist attacks within the 
United States that are inspired by the ideology that gives rise to 
terrorism, as defined by the Final Report of the National Commission on 
Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (commonly known as the ``9/11 
Commission Report'').
    (c) Award of Purple Heart.--
            (1) Award required.--Chapter 57 of title 10, United States 
        Code, is amended by inserting after section 1129 the following 
        new section:
``Sec. 1129a. Purple Heart: members killed or wounded by terrorist 
              attacks perpetrated within the United States
    ``(a) For purposes of the award of the Purple Heart, the Secretary 
concerned shall treat a member of the armed forces described in 
subsection (b) in the same manner as a member who is killed or wounded 
in action as the result of an act of the enemy of the United States.
    ``(b)(1) A member of the armed forces described in this subsection 
is a member who the Secretary concerned determines was killed or 
wounded in a terrorist attack within the United States perpetrated by 
an individual or individuals expressing a political, religious, or 
ideological obligation to engage in unlawful violence directed against 
United States military operations or foreign policy, as described in 
Army Regulation 318-12 of October 2010 regarding the Military 
Intelligence Threat Awareness and Reporting Program.
    ``(2) In this subsection, the term `terrorist attack' means the 
calculated use of violence or threat of violence to inculcate fear 
intended to coerce or to intimidate governments or societies in the 
pursuit of goals that are generally political, religious, or 
ideological, as described in the Army Regulation referred to in 
paragraph (1).
    ``(3) In implementing this section, the Secretary concerned shall 
make no distinction between `international terrorism' and `domestic 
terrorism', as those terms are defined in section 2331 of title 18.
    ``(4) If a terrorist attack referred to in paragraph (1) includes, 
as victims, members of more than one armed force, the determination 
required by such paragraph shall be made jointly by the Secretaries of 
the armed forces concerned.
    ``(c) Subsection (a) shall not apply to a member of the armed 
forces whose death or wound is the result of the willful misconduct of 
the member.
    ``(d) Nothing in this section shall be interpreted--
            ``(1) to affect the designation of any individual alleged 
        to have perpetrated an attack referred to in subsection (b)(1) 
        as an enemy combatant for any purposes under law; or
            ``(2) to preempt or otherwise affect any legal proceedings 
        relating to such an attack.''.
            (2) Clerical amendment.--The table of sections at the 
        beginning of chapter 57 of such title is amended by inserting 
        after the item relating of section 1129 the following new item:

``1129a. Purple Heart: members killed or wounded by terrorist attacks 
                            perpetrated within the United States.''.
            (3) Retroactive effective date and application.--
                    (A) Effective date.--The amendments made by this 
                subsection shall take effect as of January 1, 2009.
                    (B) Review of certain previous incidents.--The 
                Secretaries of the military departments (and the 
                Secretary of Homeland Security with respect to the 
                Coast Guard) shall undertake a review of each death or 
                wounding of a member of the Armed Forces that occurred 
                within the United States between January 1, 2009, and 
                the date of the enactment of this Act under 
                circumstances that could qualify the death or wounding 
                as being the result of a terrorist attack within the 
                United States to determine whether the death or 
                wounding does qualify as a death or wounding resulting 
                from a terrorist attack within the United States for 
                purposes of section 1129a of title 10, United States 
                Code, as added by this subsection.
                    (C) Actions following review.--If the death or 
                wounding of a member of the Armed Forces reviewed under 
                subparagraph (B) is determined to qualify as a death or 
                wounding resulting from a terrorist attack within the 
                United States for purposes of such section 1129a, the

AWARD OF PURPLE HEART TO MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES KILLED 
              OR WOUNDED IN TERRORIST ATTACKS WITHIN THE UNITED STATES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Final Report of the National Commission on 
        Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (commonly known as the 
        ``9/11 Commission Report'') recognizes that there is a certain 
        ideology that gives rise to terrorism.
            (2) This ideology that gives rise to terrorism can even 
        influence citizens and residents of the United States to 
        perpetrate attacks within the United States against members of 
        the Armed Forces.
            (3) Two such attacks have already occurred within the 
        United States, one at a recruiting station in Little Rock, 
        Arkansas, on June 1, 2009, and one at Fort Hood, Texas, on 
        November 5, 2009.
            (4) According to investigative reports released by the 
        Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives 
        and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs 
        of the Senate at least 33 threats, plots, and strikes related 
        to domestic terrorism against United States military 
        communities have been uncovered since September 11, 2001.
            (5) These threats, plots, and strikes demonstrate that 
        members of the Armed Forces are at risk of terrorist attack not 
        only when deployed overseas, but also while stationed within 
        the United States.
            (6) The Department of Defense has recognized the threat 
        posed by terrorist attacks, including those perpetrated by a 
        member of the Armed Forces, by issuing revised regulations, 
        including Army Regulation 381-12 regarding the Military 
        Intelligence Threat Awareness and Reporting Program, to require 
        reporting of potential terrorist insider threat activity, 
        including when a member of the Armed Forces is ``advocating the 
        use of unlawful violence or force to achieve goals that are 
        political, religious, or ideological in nature''.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Secretary of Defense (and the Secretary of Homeland Security with 
respect to the Coast Guard) should duly honor those members of the 
Armed Forces who are killed or wounded in terrorist attacks within the 
United States that are inspired by the ideology that gives rise to 
terrorism, as defined by the Final Report of the National Commission on 
Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (commonly known as the ``9/11 
Commission Report'').
    (c) Award of Purple Heart.--
            (1) Award required.--Chapter 57 of title 10, United States 
        Code, is amended by inserting after section 1129 the following 
        new section:
``Sec. 1129a. Purple Heart: members killed or wounded by terrorist 
              attacks perpetrated within the United States
    ``(a) For purposes of the award of the Purple Heart, the Secretary 
concerned shall treat a member of the armed forces described in 
subsection (b) in the same manner as a member who is killed or wounded 
in action as the result of an act of the enemy of the United States.
    ``(b)(1) A member of the armed forces described in this subsection 
is a member who the Secretary concerned determines was killed or 
wounded in a terrorist attack within the United States perpetrated by 
an individual or individuals expressing a political, religious, or 
ideological obligation to engage in unlawful violence directed against 
United States military operations or foreign policy, as described in 
Army Regulation 318-12 of October 2010 regarding the Military 
Intelligence Threat Awareness and Reporting Program.
    ``(2) In this subsection, the term `terrorist attack' means the 
calculated use of violence or threat of violence to inculcate fear 
intended to coerce or to intimidate governments or societies in the 
pursuit of goals that are generally political, religious, or 
ideological, as described in the Army Regulation referred to in 
paragraph (1).
    ``(3) In implementing this section, the Secretary concerned shall 
make no distinction between `international terrorism' and `domestic 
terrorism', as those terms are defined in section 2331 of title 18.
    ``(4) If a terrorist attack referred to in paragraph (1) includes, 
as victims, members of more than one armed force, the determination 
required by such paragraph shall be made jointly by the Secretaries of 
the armed forces concerned.
    ``(c) Subsection (a) shall not apply to a member of the armed 
forces whose death or wound is the result of the willful misconduct of 
the member.
    ``(d) Nothing in this section shall be interpreted--
            ``(1) to affect the designation of any individual alleged 
        to have perpetrated an attack referred to in subsection (b)(1) 
        as an enemy combatant for any purposes under law; or
            ``(2) to preempt or otherwise affect any legal proceedings 
        relating to such an attack.''.
            (2) Clerical amendment.--The table of sections at the 
        beginning of chapter 57 of such title is amended by inserting 
        after the item relating of section 1129 the following new item:

``1129a. Purple Heart: members killed or wounded by terrorist attacks 
                            perpetrated within the United States.''.
            (3) Retroactive effective date and application.--
                    (A) Effective date.--The amendments made by this 
                subsection shall take effect as of January 1, 2009.
                    (B) Review of certain previous incidents.--The 
                Secretaries of the military departments (and the 
                Secretary of Homeland Security with respect to the 
                Coast Guard) shall undertake a review of each death or 
                wounding of a member of the Armed Forces that occurred 
                within the United States between January 1, 2009, and 
                the date of the enactment of this Act under 
                circumstances that could qualify the death or wounding 
                as being the result of a terrorist attack within the 
                United States to determine whether the death or 
                wounding does qualify as a death or wounding resulting 
                from a terrorist attack within the United States for 
                purposes of section 1129a of title 10, United States 
                Code, as added by this subsection.
                    (C) Actions following review.--If the death or 
                wounding of a member of the Armed Forces reviewed under 
                subparagraph (B) is determined to qualify as a death or 
                wounding resulting from a terrorist attack within the 
                United States for purposes of such section 1129a, the 
                Secretary of the military department concerned (or the

    This Act may be cited as the ``Long Island Sound Stewardship Act of 
2004''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) Long Island Sound is a national treasure of great 
        cultural, environmental, and ecological importance;
            (2) 8,000,000 people live within the Long Island Sound 
        watershed and 28,000,000 people (approximately 10 percent of 
        the population of the United States) live within 50 miles of 
        Long Island Sound;
            (3) activities that depend on the environmental health of 
        Long Island Sound contribute more than $5,000,000,000 each year 
        to the regional economy;
            (4) the portion of the shoreline of Long Island Sound that 
        is accessible to the general public (estimated at less than 20 
        percent of the total shoreline) is not adequate to serve the 
        needs of the people living in the area;
            (5) existing shoreline facilities are in many cases 
        overburdened and underfunded;
            (6) large parcels of open space already in public ownership 
        are strained by the effort to balance the demand for recreation 
        with the needs of sensitive natural resources;
            (7) approximately \1/3\ of the tidal marshes of Long Island 
        Sound have been filled, and much of the remaining marshes have 
        been ditched, dyked, or impounded, reducing the ecological 
        value of the marshes; and
            (8) many of the remaining exemplary natural landscape is 
        vulnerable to further development.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish the Long 
Island Sound Stewardship System to preserve areas of critical 
importance because of the open space, public access, and ecological 
value of the areas.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Long Island Sound Stewardship Act of 
2004''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) Long Island Sound is a national treasure of great 
        cultural, environmental, and ecological importance;
            (2) 8,000,000 people live within the Long Island Sound 
        watershed and 28,000,000 people (approximately 10 percent of 
        the population of the United States) live within 50 miles of 
        Long Island Sound;
            (3) activities that depend on the environmental health of 
        Long Island Sound contribute more than $5,000,000,000 each year 
        to the regional economy;
            (4) the portion of the shoreline of Long Island Sound that 
        is accessible to the general public (estimated at less than 20 
        percent of the total shoreline) is not adequate to serve the 
        needs of the people living in the area;
            (5) existing shoreline facilities are in many cases 
        overburdened and underfunded;
            (6) large parcels of open space already in public ownership 
        are strained by the effort to balance the demand for recreation 
        with the needs of sensitive natural resources;
            (7) approximately \1/3\ of the tidal marshes of Long Island 
        Sound have been filled, and much of the remaining marshes have 
        been ditched, dyked, or impounded, reducing the ecological 
        value of the marshes; and
            (8) many of the remaining exemplary natural landscape is 
        vulnerable to further development.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish the Long 
Island Sound Stewardship System to preserve areas of critical 
importance because of the open space, public access, and ecological 
value of the areas.
