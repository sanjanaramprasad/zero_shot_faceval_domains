His co-defendant, Zoheb Majid, 20, was sentenced to 10 years behind bars for manslaughter and robbery.","A boy of 13 has become one of the UK's youngest murderers after he was jailed for killing a woman he had just mugged by stamping on her face so hard it left a footprint on her cheek. Shocking CCTV footage shows the horrendous moment Petri Kurti murdered 47-year-old Glynis Bensley before he fled to a nearby park in Smethwick, West Midlands and boasted about the savage attack. The schoolboy, who can be named after a judge lifted a reporting restriction order, was jailed for a minimum of 12 years today and will be on licence for life. His co-defendant, Zoheb Majid, was sentenced to 10 years behind bars for manslaughter and robbery. Scroll down for video . CCTV of the attack was shown in court, with 13-year-old Kurti seen jumping Ms Bensley as she walked home. Co-defendant Majid then joined in, with the pair leaving her for dead in a pool of her own blood . Killed: Glynis Bensley was murdered by Petri Kurti, 13, as she walked home in Smethwick, West Midlands . Sentencing Judge John Warner said the boy had been 'running wild' in his home life. 'You come from a home where there has been a complete lack of boundaries or structure where neither parents understand the seriousness of your behaviour - they blame others. 'This reinforces your own clear reluctance to take responsibility for your own actions.' Previously the court heard how the pair had teamed up with the sole intention of carrying out a violent robbery. CCTV footage captured Kurti jumping Ms Bensley in the street as she made her way home from Seven Stars pub. Majid joined in seconds later before the pair flipped her body over to ransack her pockets. Kurti was then filmed stamping on her face, leaving a shoe print on her skin. The court previously heard that both Majid and the teenager thought Ms Bensley was a man because of her clothes and haircut. He pleaded guilty to manslaughter but was found guilty of murder following a trial last month. Kurti had been excluded from school and a pupil referral unit for his aggressive behaviour, and as young as he was, already had previous convictions for attempted theft, assault with intent to steal and battery. He sentenced the 13-year-old to 12 years imprisonment for the murder with five years concurrent for robbery. Also jailed: Zoheb Majid, 20, was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment for manslaughter and robbery . He was given another 12 months, to run concurrently, for another street robbery carried out with his 25-year-old sister whilst on bail for the murder on February 4. The teenager was ordered to be detained at Her Majesty's Pleasure - the equivalent of a minimum term life sentence for a youth. Judge Warner added while Kurti had boasted of the attack afterwards, he demonstrated 'criminal maturity'. 'I'm in no doubt that she was targeted by you both, selected to be robbed' he continued. 'She was chosen by you because she was clearly in a vulnerable condition. 'It started with you Petri Kurti punching her and she went to the ground. 'She suffered a minimum of two blows. There was a clear print of a shod foot visible on her cheek, she had been stamped in the face. 'You Petri Kurti were just 13 when you committed this murder, on the streets late at night effectively running wild. 'This was a murder committed for gain, a night time robbery. The victim was vulnerable and targeted as such. 'Zoheb Majid, you're about to turn 21. 'You knew what you were doing and knew what you were involved in. You knew the victim of this night time robbery was a vulnerable person.' Earlier the court was told Kurti 'was not a mature' 13-year-old. His solicitor, Michael Turner QC, said: 'He's operating at a level of a seven to 11-year-old in terms of his cognitive ability. 'He has real learning difficulties. He accepted the act that caused the death and limited the decision of the jury to one of intent. Distraught family: Ms Bensley's siblings, Dawn and Harry Bensley, were at Wolverhampton Crown Court today to see their sister's killer jailed . 'He is susceptible to control and influence by those older than him.' After their sentencing Ms Bensley's family spoke of their horror that the 13-year-old had been out so late and behaving in such a violent way. 'It opens your eyes to a different world. We are talking two o'clock, four o'clock in the morning - that is not a normal 13-year-old,' said John Bensley, 60. 'They are cowards, the way they did it. She was an easy target.' 'Justice has been done. If it hadn't happened to Glynis it would have happened to someone else. It could have happened to anybody. 'They seemed a bit arrogant in court, there was no remorse. They are not sorry, they are sorry they have been caught."" Paying tribute to the charity worker, Ms Bensley's sister, Dawn, said: 'She loved working for charities. She just liked to help people, she would help anybody."" Detective Chief Inspector Samantha Ridding said the pair had intended to target someone in a violent robbery . Her brother Kevin, 53, added: 'Glynis had walked down that road for 30 years and never had a problem. 'She walked the same way for 30 years, they must have crossed paths before. Whether he was 13, 33, or 53, it doesn't make it any easier.' Leading the investigation Detective Chief Inspector Sam Ridding said: 'It was clearly the joint intention of the pair to use violence on anyone they targeted: they were in it together as the CCTV showed - they arrived within seconds of each other.

4,39335887_gpt3_gen,"Ivanka Trump, US President Donald Trump's daughter, will become an unpaid White House adviser, according to an announcement. The 35-year-old, who will not have an official position, will be granted security clearance and access to classified material when she joins her husband Jared Kushner, who has been named as a senior adviser to her father. Federal anti-nepotism laws prevent relatives of the president receiving such appointments, but an exception was granted to Kushner after the Justice Department cited the president's ""special hiring authority"". Ethics campaigners have criticised the Trumps for potential conflicts of interest.
","The 35-year-old will have security clearance and access to classified information, but no official title or salary when she works in the West Wing.
She will serve as her father's ""eyes and ears"" while providing broad-ranging advice, her attorney told Politico.
Ms Trump, who owns a fashion brand, will join husband Jared Kushner, who is a senior adviser to the president.
The US first daughter said in a statement: ""While there is no modern precedent for an adult child of the president, I will voluntarily follow all of the ethics rules placed on government employees.
""I will continue to offer my father my candid advice and counsel, as I have for my entire life.""
After Mr Kushner's White House appointment was announced, Ms Trump said she would focus on settling her family in Washington rather than work for the administration.
Her step-mother, First Lady Melania Trump, has so far chosen to stay in New York with Mr Trump's youngest son.
Ms Trump's lawyer, Jamie Gorelick, told AP news agency: ""Our view is that the conservative approach is for Ivanka to voluntarily comply with the rules that would apply if she were a government employee, even though she is not.""
But some have criticised the decision to give her a White House position, even though she will have no actual job title.
Andrew Herman, an attorney who has advised lawmakers on ethics issues, said: ""I think the right way to do that is to make her a special government employee.
""But that implicates all kind of formal and disclosure issues.""
The political influence of the US first daughter and her husband has raised questions about possible conflicts of interests.
Federal anti-nepotism laws bar relatives of the president from being appointed to government positions.
But an exception was made for Mr Kushner after the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel cited the president's ""special hiring authority"".
Since the election Ms Trump has placed her fashion company's interests in a trust, handing off day-to-day operations to her top executive.
Her brother-in-law and sister-in-law, Josh Kushner and Nicole Meyer, have been named trustees, reports the New York Times.
However, several retailers have dropped her products, saying that sales of her brand were falling.
Ms Trump is also being sued by a fashion company in San Francisco that says she is cashing in on her position as first daughter.
Modern Appealing Clothing said in court documents filed last week that Ms Trump's firm has an ""unfair advantage"" in the marketplace.
She has already forbidden her eponymous brand from advertising using images of her taken since the inauguration.
Since Mr Trump's inauguration in January, Ms Trump has been seen attending meetings with world leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, last week, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

Renee Ellmers. 'She's a b**ch!' Aiken told SiriusXM radio host Howard Stern, discussing his Esquire Network documetary program that chronicles his failed bid for a seat in the House of Representatives. The show is called 'The Runner-Up,' a reference both to ths election and to his second-place finish in the second season of American Idol. American Idol runner-up and congressional election runner-up Clay Aiken body-slammed Rep. Renee Ellmers on Monday's Howard Stern Show, calling her a 'b**ch' and an 'idiot' Ellmers, an intensive-care nurse by training, beat a seven-term incumbent in 2010 and won a third term by crushing Aiken in November . Ellmers, an intensive-care nurse who married a surgeon, plays an unwitting part in the show. 'She’s an idiot,' said Aiken, 36. 'And I think her self-esteem is just in the floor. Under the floor.' The 51-year-old congresswoman captured 58.8 per cent of the vote on her way to a third term, compared with Aiken's 41.2 per cent. He won the Democratic primary when his chief rival, businessman Keith Crisco, died suddenly after a fall. Crisco was a former state secretary of commerce and a political veteran. Aiken is sketching out a second political life on the small screen, and lobbed some publicity for his show at Stern's gigantic audience – along with some slaps at Ellmers. 'You should see the second episode, because she’s a bitch,' he said during the interview. A spokeswoman for Ellmers scoffed at Aiken, telling Daily Mail Online that his 'crude language and disrespectful demeanor towards the congresswoman has proven to the American people why he is a runner up.' Aiken doesn't much seem to care. He's already planning the third act in his political play, telling Stern that he's planning a future bid for elective office. MISSED IT BY THAT MUCH: Aiken conceded the race to Ellmers in November after she shellacked him by a nearly 18-point margin . 'Within the next decade I will [run] again,' he said. But 'not right now. Probably before six years.' Aiken, who is openly gay, also dove deep into his love life, telling Stern how hard he found it to date in New York City. He said he has stayed away from anonymous hookup apps like Grindr, insisting that he's 'not as much of a whore as people would like to think.' It seems Aiken picks his paramours from among men who friend him on Facebook. 'Here’s the honest truth: When people friend me – God, I'm goign to admit this to people – when people friend me, if it’s a guy who’s really cute, I’ll accept him,' he said. 'And then I’ll look at the pictures.' Suddenly realizing that he had unleashed a flood of male admirers who might stalk him on social media, Aiken let out a shriek, and shouted: 'S**t!'

Coroner said she would now write to Government chiefs to ask why swimming is not included in secondary school education. Swimming is compulsory during primary school but is not enforced for those aged 11 or over.","A coroner has questioned the lack of swimming in the national curriculum after Rony John, 15, drowned on the first day of his summer holidays . A coroner has raised concerns over the lack of swimming lessons included in the national curriculum after a 15-year-old drowned in a river on the first day of his summer holidays. Rony John, 15, died after jumping into the River Great Ouse in Hartford, Cambridgeshire, despite being unable to swim. At an inquest into his death, the coroner said she would now write to Government chiefs to ask why swimming is not included in secondary school education. The hearing heard that swimming is compulsory during primary school but is not enforced for those aged 11 or over. Assistant Cambridgeshire Coroner Belinda Cheney said: 'Swimming is not a difficult skill to learn yet it is a critical life skill.' The hearing heard how Rony was with friends on the bank of the river in July last year when he dived into the water. When it was clear he was in difficulty, Rony's friends desperately tried to rescue the teenager. A group of adults also attempted to bring the young boy to safety, while firefighters arrived at the scene within ten minutes. But an inquest heard how Rony was swept away by the current and would have died within four minutes of jumping into the water. His body was not found until the following day. The hearing, which took place in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, heard how Rony came to Britain from India in 2012 and did not know how to swim. According to his headteacher, Mr Bennet said he had been eligible for six 30-minute lessons a year at St. Peter's School in Huntingdon. But Christopher Bennet said that he had also been excused from some of the sessions after taking notes to school, written by his family, requesting he not take part. Just weeks after Rony's death, the school also cancelled swimming lessons for all older pupils. After the hearing, Mr Bennet said: 'Rony came to school at the beginning of year eight. As his family said in the inquest he needed help to stay afloat. The teenager was swimming with friends in the Great River Ouse at Hatford, Cambridgeshire in July last year . Firefighters were on the scene within ten minutes and his friends also tried to bring Rony to safety, but the young man could not be saved . 'Pupils of his age were entitled to six half-an-hour lessons a year and we know that for all of the lessons that took place he was in school. 'We know that he attended some of those lessons but he also came in with notes which could have come from the family stating that he couldn't take part.' He added: 'Swimming is in the national curriculum for primary school pupils but not for those in secondary education. 'We had to cancel lessons for secondary school pupils because of the cost and it would be beneficial to have extra provisions for those students. 'It is a life skill and at the end of the day we live on an island so we are never very far away from water.' Tributes were left at the scene, on the bank of the river, following Rony's death. His headteacher Christopher Bennet said he was a 'hugely popular young man' He added that Rony was a 'hugely popular young man' and there were plans for a memorial cricket match on the first anniversary of his death. Rony's father John Thomas, from Huntingdon, told the inquest: 'He was extremely well-behaved. He was always a good boy.' Yesterday, Moses Yitzchok Greenfeld, 19, from Stamford Hill, London, drowned in Hampstead Heath pond after going for a swim with four friends in the 25C heat. His body was eventually discovered five foot below the surface and 20ft from the water's edge just before 11pm on Wednesday - nearly six hours after he was reported in trouble at 5.30pm. It is thought Mr Greenfield may have had a cardiac arrest because of the shock of jumping into the cold water. It has since been claimed that police officers 'watched' as the desperately tried to save their friend. An eyewitness has said at least seven police officers stood on a bank and watched as the boys dived in and out looking for their friend.",cnndm_generic,Flan T5,,factual,factual,,,,,,,,

Some of our most spectacular views of Mars have been presented on small, skinny strips of imagery.Now scientists have, for the first time, joined these individual 30 to 60 mile (50 to 100km) wide strips together to create a single complete 3D map. Pictured is a view of a section of the image map Mosaic 'MC-11 East' is on the right and the topographical view can be seen on the left. The warmer colours show a higher elevation . The colour-coded terrain models show the impressive height of the Meridiani Planum region at up to 820ft (250 metres) above the surface, seen in red. This is in contrast to the blue 1,6404ft (5,000 metres) depth of the lower-lying Chryse Planitia region. The first mosaic, pieced together by the German Aerospace Center (DLR), comprises 1.4 million square miles (2.3 million square km) of the surface. It covers the vast crater-strewn highland region of the red planet, parts of the Ares Vallis outflow channel, the chaotic Aram Chaos region as well as the Meridiani Planum and Chryse Planitia plains. The new map allows scientists to 'stand' on planetary surfaces and could help explain how water and lava once flowed across Mars. Pictured is a colour-coded perspective view showing the topography of the upper course of Ares Vallis near the Chryse Planitia plains . Constructing a 3D model such as this requires a spacecraft to look at the same surface feature twice at a different angle. The High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) on Mars Express is the only experiment that can do it with just one pass. HRSC has nine scan lines that point fore, aft and straight down. This allows it to see a feature on approach, when its underneath and as it fades into the background. HRSC has, during 14,000 orbits, transmitted 293.34 gigabytes of data to Earth. 'Gerhard Mercator and Carl Friedrich Gauss measured Earth, and with our survey of Mars we are following in their footsteps,' says Ralf Jaumann, a DLR planetary scientist. The mosaic extends over 1,120 miles (1800km) from north to south and 810 miles (1,300km) from east to west. Individual stereo and colour images from a total of 89 Martian orbits were combined to create the map. 'The strips were recorded at varying resolutions, with the sun at different positions and under varying weather conditions,' Jaumann said. 'The challenge was to combine them uniformly and without visible borders to form one large image.' Perspective views look into the Ares Vallis outflow channel or into a crater altered by typical Mars erosion processes typical on Mars. 'At present, you cannot create a better image of the surface of Mars to show, for example, of the effects of flood and drought,' said Jaumann.

HRSC has, during the course of more than 14,000 orbits, recorded and transmitted a total of 293.34 gigabytes of data to Earth.

Rolling Stone's egregious mistakes of reporting and editing are regrettable but understandable. The magazine's decision not to fire anybody or reorganize its newsroom operation is not. Before the original story, ""A Rape on Campus,"" was pulled from the Rolling Stone website, it registered 2.7 million hits following its publication in November -- more than any noncelebrity story in the magazine's history. An anonymous undergraduate, given the name ""Jackie,"" told Rolling Stone writer Sabrina Rubin Erdely she had been invited to a party thrown by Phi Kappa Psi fraternity in 2012 -- only to end up beaten and gang-raped by seven boys, who were allegedly coached along in the attack by the same student, a casual acquaintance, who had invited Jackie to the party. The horrific allegations sparked protests against the fraternity,  a police investigation, the temporary suspension of all fraternities at the school and a nationwide debate about the prevalence of sexual violence on college campuses. But the story began to unravel almost immediately when Washington Post reporter T. Rees Shapiro took a closer look, leading Rolling Stone to back away from the story and request a review by the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. That review, which is considerably longer than the original article, reveals startling lapses in basic journalistic practice. Rolling Stone writer Erdely never verified the identity of the attacker and therefore never confronted him with the allegations; she never spoke to three of Jackie's friends who allegedly talked with Jackie immediately after the attack, and she never gave the fraternity a fair chance to respond, refusing to provide specific information about what happened and when. And at every step of the way, when Jackie began acting flaky -- refusing to provide basic information needed to verify her story or vanishing for weeks at a time without returning calls from the reporter -- neither Erdely nor her editors or the magazine's fact checkers made the hard but necessary decision to hit the pause button and decline to run the story. Having worked part time as a journalism professor for a decade (including one semester at Columbia), I would agree with colleagues who call Rolling Stone's lapses the kind that would be unacceptable in a freshman classroom. I've told students for years: You should never print allegations without giving people a fair chance to respond. And you should never take a source's word about important facts without verifying the truth. (There's a reason we call it reporting and not dictation.) Most of all, I tell students, remember that you're writing about human beings, who are complicated creatures: The good guys are never all that good, and the bad guys usually aren't completely bad. People can be mistaken or deceitful, I tell young reporters, they frequently forget and often lie to themselves. That doesn't make a source useless, but it must make you extra careful. Unfortunately, the early word from Rolling Stone is that they've absorbed none of these lessons. Publisher Jann Wenner has apparently decided not to fire, demote or discipline anybody at Rolling Stone, provoking expressions of disbelief among seasoned journalists. ""No one fired at Rolling Stone. Really?"" wrote CNN media critic Brian Stelter. ""What would Rolling Stone in its heyday write about an institution that screwed up unbelievably, damaged people's lives, but punished no one?"" tweeted John Bresnahan, the Capitol bureau chief of Politico. ""Rolling Stone outsources its investigation to Columbia and proceeds to do nothing in terms of individual accountability afterward? OK...,"" tweeted pundit Joe Concha. Worse still, the editors who committed the blunder seem unprepared to revamp their operation to prevent a repeat of the debacle, framing the error as an earnest but misguided attempt to believe the word of a sexual assault victim. ""Rolling Stone's senior editors are unanimous in the belief that the story's failure does not require them to change their editorial systems,"" the Columbia report says. And check out this amazing conclusion from Will Dana, the managing editor who presided over the disaster. Dana told the Columbia team: ""It's not like I think we need to overhaul our process, and I don't think we need to necessarily institute a lot of new ways of doing things. We just have to do what we've always done and just make sure we don't make this mistake again."" That smug attitude pretty much ensures Rolling Stone's newsroom managers will commit another goof in the future. At a minimum, they should heed the wise counsel of my friend Bill Grueskin, an executive editor at Bloomberg who formerly served as dean of academic affairs at the Columbia J-school. ""When doing big, investigative stories, reporters face many challenges: recalcitrant sources, complex numbers, buried records. Editors, whose labors are usually cloaked in anonymity, are spared most of those hurdles.

The Brussels raids were carried out by 200 police, and officials say they targeted a group returning from Syria who had been about to launch attacks in a matter of hours; they also say this linked to the Charlie Hebdo attacks.

","A third person had been arrested in the raid in Verviers and weapons are reported to have been recovered.
Prosecutor Eric Van Der Sypt told reporters police had targeted a group returning from Syria who had been about to launch attacks in a matter of hours.
Suspects had opened fire on police, he said. There were also overnight searches in the Brussels area.
Speaking after Thursday's raids in Verviers, Mr Van Der Sypt said: ""The suspects immediately and for several minutes opened fire with military weaponry and handguns on the special units of the federal police before they were neutralised.""
After the raid, four Kalashnikovs, bomb-making equipment and police clothing were found, according to local media. Security forces remain in the Verviers area.
Anti-terror raids also took place late on Thursday in Brussels and surrounding towns, including Sint-Jans-Molenbeek, Anderlecht and Schaerbeek.
Earlier on Thursday two suspected Islamists were arrested in the Brussels suburb of Zaventem, local media reported.
Belgian officials say more than 300 people have left Belgium to fight with Islamic militant groups in Syria and Iraq.
Belgian journalist Mark Eeckhaut told the BBC the suspects in Verviers had wanted to attack a police station and cause a large number of casualties.
The terror threat level in Belgium has been raised to three - the second highest, Mr Van Der Sypt said.
Witnesses in Verviers reported hearing heavy gunfire for several minutes and at least three explosions.
Witness Marylou Fletcher told the BBC: ""We were going back from shopping and saw the police cars. We thought there was an accident then we heard something blowing up. There were a lot of gunshots.

45,32691589_flant5_gen,The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) is a hugely controversial trade deal between the EU and the US.,"The big political parties didn't make much of it during the campaign. Both the Conservatives and Labour are broadly in favour, though the Greens are very critical. TTIP was however addressed in the manifestos. War on Want (who oppose the plans) have compiled the parties' positions on the issue.
Outside the political arena there are some very strong opinions. Many business voices are enthusiastic, but there is also very vocal opposition.
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, or it will be if the negotiations are completed.  The aim is to boost the economies of the EU and the US by removing or reducing barriers to trade and foreign investment.
President Obama said, when the talks were launched, that TTIP would promote ""new growth and jobs on both sides of the Atlantic"".  Critics reject that claim - more of that below.
A study by the Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR) - done for the European Commission - estimated the potential gains for the EU as up to €119bn (£85bn; $134bn) a year and €95bn (£68bn; $107bn) for the US.
For a family of four that comes to €545 per year in the EU and €655 in the US.  Wages would be higher, by 0.5% in the EU and just under 0.4% in the US.
The CEPR has done a more specific estimate of the benefits for the UK, which suggested gains in annual national income of up to £10bn.
By eliminating almost all tariffs (taxes applied only to imported goods) on trade between the US and the EU.
But the tariffs imposed by the US and EU are already relatively low for the most part, although there are some exceptions in, for example, farm produce and textiles.
The bigger gains envisaged would come from reducing what are called non-tariff barriers. In particular the two sides think they can promote trade through what they call regulatory co-operation.
This is about costs to business. Complying with regulations involves a cost. A firm that wants to export may incur further costs meeting the regulatory requirements of the country it's selling into.
The European Commission says that rules in Europe and the US often achieve the same level of consumer safety and product quality, but differ in their technical details and their methods for ensuring that firms have met the rules.
One of the aims of TTIP is to reduce this burden on business. One option is recognising one another's standards. That's under consideration for many types of goods. They also plan to co-operate more closely on new regulation.
That basic idea is that by reducing the cost of exporting, TTIP would encourage more of it.
The idea here is to encourage transatlantic foreign investment. The European Commission says an agreement in this area would prohibit discrimination against foreign investors, expropriation, denying access to the courts and arbitrary and abusive treatment.
If a foreign investor felt these rules had been violated, they would have access to a system known as investor state dispute settlement, or ISDS. This is a system of tribunals that could award compensation to the investor if they had lost money as a result of a breach of the rules in the agreement.
Regulation
Much of the concern is about the regulatory aspect: that it would lead to lower standards of consumer and environmental protection and safety at work. A group of 170 European civil society organisations said in a statement that regulatory co-operation as envisaged in TTIP would result in ""downward harmonisation"".
There is also a concern that TTIP could undermine governments' right to regulate in the public interest.  They say it will also give business groups a disproportionate influence over new regulation, and therefore, they argue, it is undemocratic.
Economic benefits
Others question the analysis behind claims that TTIP will be economically beneficial. Jeronim Capaldo of Tufts University in the US says the European Commission's study makes unrealistic assumptions about how easy it would be for workers who lose their jobs to find new employment. He argues that Europe would actually be worse off, in terms of economic activity, wages and government revenue.
Investment
There are also questions about whether a TTIP agreement would really stimulate more investment.  A London School of Economics Study for the British  Department of Business, Innovation, and Skills concluded that an investment chapter would be ""highly unlikely to encourage investment above and beyond what would otherwise take place"".
ISDS has generated a lot of heated opposition. One complaint is that it will discourage governments from regulating in the public interest. Olivier Hoedeman of Corporate Europe Observatory, a Brussels-based campaign group, said it would act as a ""chill factor"" on governments who would fear that business regulation might lead to protracted legal challenges and bills for compensation.
ISDS arrangements are common in international investment agreements. But research by the United Nations Commission on Trade and Development suggests investors have made more use of the tribunal system in recent years.
Perhaps the most high-profile - some would say notorious - examples were the actions taken by the tobacco company Philip Morris against Uruguay and Australia over new rules on the packaging of their products, rules intended to make them less attractive to consumers. Neither case has been completed.
There is a particular concern expressed by British campaigners about the possible impact of ISDS on the National Health Service.
There is, they argue, a danger that if a government wants to reverse any arrangements to contract services out to private suppliers, it might risk being sued under ISDS. European and British officials insist that TTIP's ISDS provisions won't have that effect, but many campaigners don't believe it.
A summit of European leaders in December called for a comprehensive agreement by the end of 2015, though the European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmström has said that is probably unrealistic.
That will be challenging, given the technical complexity and the vigorous opposition. It would then have to be approved by the European Parliament and European Trade Ministers. The Ministers usually vote on trade by what is called qualified majority though unanimity might be required - that is both a legal question and a matter of political judgement.
Depending on the legal nature of the final agreement it might also need to be approved by all the EU member states, and Commissioner Malmström has said that is likely to be necessary. So there is plenty of scope for delays.
And it will need approval by the US Congress. President Obama is struggling unsuccessfully so far - to get Congress to give him what is called Trade Promotion Authority which would make US ratification less difficult.
There is a global trade negotiation under way in the World Trade Organization (WTO). It's known as the Doha Round, because that is where it was launched - back in 2001.
It has been very slow. At the end of 2013 the WTO members finally agreed a part of that agenda. It's called the Trade Facilitation Agreement and it's about the mechanics of international commerce - customs procedures, for example. The really hard stuff is still not agreed. Trade Facilitation is sometimes called the Doha Round's ""low-hanging fruit"", yet it still took 12 years to pick.
Frustration with the slow pace has led many countries to pursue bilateral and regional deals.  The WTO's Director General Roberto Azevedo has said: ""These initiatives are important for the multilateral (global) trading system — but they do not substitute it.""

51,26135627_flant5_gen,US actress Shirley Temple has died at the age of 87.,"With her adorable charm and blonde curls, she was one of the most popular stars of the 1930s, in hit movies like Bright Eyes and Stand Up and Cheer.
After retiring from films in 1950 at the age of 21, Temple returned to the spotlight as a politician and diplomat.
She died on Monday at home in Woodside, California, from natural causes. ""She was surrounded by her family and caregivers,"" a statement said.
Born in 1928, Temple soon became a major star after getting her first film role at the age of three.
Her singing, dancing and acting won over fans worldwide. She was given a special juvenile Oscar in 1935, when she was just six years old. To this day, she is still the youngest person to receive an Academy Award.
With the nickname ""America's little darling"", she was ranked as Hollywood's biggest draw for four years running from 1935 to '38 in an annual poll of US cinema owners.
Her rendition of the song On the Good Ship Lollipop in the film Bright Eyes was among her most famous performances.
Sources:  Shirleytemple.com/IMDB
Her other films included Curly Top, The Littlest Rebel, Baby Take a Bow and Little Miss Marker.
She was such a hit that US president Franklin Delano Roosevelt dubbed her ""Little Miss Miracle"" for raising morale during the Great Depression and she was credited with helping save 20th Century Fox from bankruptcy.
Temple starred in a total of 43 feature films - but found it difficult to sustain her career in adulthood and left acting behind in 1950.
She continued to appear on television, but that work dried up and she eventually stepped away from the spotlight.
When she came back into the public eye, it was in a new guise. Under her married name Shirley Temple Black, she ran as a Republican candidate for Congress in 1967 but lost.

52,26135627_gpt3_gen,"Shirley Temple, one of the most popular stars of the 1930s, has died at home in California at the age of 85 from natural causes. Temple was given her first film role at three years old and her singing, dancing and acting won over fans worldwide. She was awarded a special juvenile Oscar in 1935 at just six years old, and is still the youngest person ever to receive an Academy Award. After retiring from films in 1950, Temple returned to the spotlight as a politician and diplomat, running as a Republican candidate for Congress in 1967 but losing. In 1974 she was appointed as the US ambassador to Ghana and in 1989 as the US ambassador  to Czechoslovakia.","With her adorable charm and blonde curls, she was one of the most popular stars of the 1930s, in hit movies like Bright Eyes and Stand Up and Cheer.
After retiring from films in 1950 at the age of 21, Temple returned to the spotlight as a politician and diplomat.
She died on Monday at home in Woodside, California, from natural causes. ""She was surrounded by her family and caregivers,"" a statement said.
Born in 1928, Temple soon became a major star after getting her first film role at the age of three.
Her singing, dancing and acting won over fans worldwide. She was given a special juvenile Oscar in 1935, when she was just six years old. To this day, she is still the youngest person to receive an Academy Award.
With the nickname ""America's little darling"", she was ranked as Hollywood's biggest draw for four years running from 1935 to '38 in an annual poll of US cinema owners.
Her rendition of the song On the Good Ship Lollipop in the film Bright Eyes was among her most famous performances.

Her other films included Curly Top, The Littlest Rebel, Baby Take a Bow and Little Miss Marker.
She was such a hit that US president Franklin Delano Roosevelt dubbed her ""Little Miss Miracle"" for raising morale during the Great Depression and she was credited with helping save 20th Century Fox from bankruptcy.
Temple starred in a total of 43 feature films - but found it difficult to sustain her career in adulthood and left acting behind in 1950.
She continued to appear on television, but that work dried up and she eventually stepped away from the spotlight.
When she came back into the public eye, it was in a new guise. Under her married name Shirley Temple Black, she ran as a Republican candidate for Congress in 1967 but lost.

55,30002988_gpt3_gen,"The number of children put up for adoption in the UK has fallen by almost half in the last year, according to figures released by the Adoption Leadership Board. Whereas there were 1,830 initial decisions to place a child for adoption in the three months ended September 2013, there were just 960 in the same period this year. The Board believes that recent court judgements are responsible for the fall. ALB chairman, Sir Martin Narey, feels that some local authorities believe that foster care should be seen as suffcient and that the law has changed accordingly.
","In the three months to June 2014, there were 960 initial decisions to place a child for adoption, compared with 1,830 in the three months to September 2013.
The figures were released by the Adoption Leadership Board (ALB).
The ALB says the drop in adoptions may have been influenced by recent court judgements in care and adoption cases.
The board, which was established by the government as part of a shake-up of the adoption system, said applications for court orders allowing a child to be placed for adoption had fallen by 34%.
There had also been a fall of 54% in the number of placement orders granted by courts, from 1,650 to 750, it said.
In recent years, adoption figures had risen to record levels, with an increase of 63%, the ALB said.
But last September, the most senior family court judge criticised the ""sloppy practice"" of social workers when bringing cases for adoption before the courts and said they were not looking closely enough at all the other options.
President of the Family Division, Sir James Munby, also implied that, at a time of tight budgets, adoption may be seen as a cheaper option than helping troubled families or foster carers and warned about ""resource issues"" affecting local authorities' thinking.
He said there had been four cases during 10 days in July alone in which judges had expressed concerns about inadequate analysis by social services  in support of the case for adoption.
ALB chairman, Sir Martin Narey, said these court judgements had been ""entirely sensible"".
But he warned that they were being misinterpreted by local authorities who thought the law on adoption had changed.
He told the BBC that the recent drop in children being put forward for adoption was primarily due to fewer local authorities deciding adoption was the best option for a child.
""It's then been compounded by the refusal of some applications at the court,"" he said.
Sir Martin said some councils seemed to have taken some court rulings to mean that if a child could remain in foster care, then ""that will do"", when in fact the best interests of the child must be pursued.
Sir Martin said the drop followed two years of significant progress in finding more adoptive homes for the thousands of children waiting.
The number of children adopted across the UK has risen from 3,100 in 2011 to  5,050 in the last year.
The recent fall in children being put forward for adoption in England  has prompted  Sir Martin to issue guidance to clarify the meaning of recent court judgements.
""It is clear from my discussions with social workers and managers in local authorities and in voluntary adoption agencies that there is a belief that the law has been fundamentally changed by a number of court judgements.

They discovered that rather than simply tearing, mammalian skin actually has sophisticated stress resistance properties that prevent holes and cuts from expanding. They discovered that the curly fibers of collagen that make up dermis of the skin straighten and stretch in response to a tear to share the load and prevent further damage.","It is probably the most unpleasant experiment you will read about today: what happens when your skin starts to tear. Researchers have uncovered the reason why skin is so difficult to tear even when put under extreme pressures, by cutting samples of real skin and attempting to pull them apart. They found that rather than simply tearing, mammalian skin actually has sophisticated stress resistance properties that prevent holes and cuts from expanding. The researchers cut real skin samples and then attempted to rip them by pulling them apart (shown above) Using X-ray beams they were able to directly observe the microscopic changes that take place in skin to help it resist tearing during their stomach churning experiments. They discovered that the curly fibers of collagen that make up dermis of the skin straighten and stretch in response to a tear to share the load and prevent further damage. Scientists at Gillette have spent nine years studying how to get the perfect shave. Their work has shown why washing the skin is so vital and why you should never, ever tap your razor on the sink, and also settles the debate about whether you should go with, or against the grain . Here are their main findings: . Before the shave, hydrate the hair by washing the skin with a gentle cleanser: This softens the hair and significantly reduces the force needed to cut it. Apply plenty of shave gel: This provides a protective anti-friction layer and improves razor glide for a smoother, more comfortable shave. Shave with a  multi-blade razor using light strokes: Gillette said the razor should do the work, not the person shaving. Change direction: Begin by shaving with the grain of the hair before switching and going against this grain. Make sure blades are not old or dull: The lifespan of razors can vary depending on how often they are used and how hard. As a general rule if the razor begins to drag or doesn't cut as closely as before, replace the blades. Use aftershave: This can be any product containing moisturiser to rehydrate and comfort the skin. Many aftershaves contain alcohol that acts as an astringent to sterilise the skin and provide a barrier against infection. The findings help to explain why the thin layer of cells that cover our bodies is able to provide such an effective barrier to the outside world. Scientists behind the research also hope their findings could eventually lead to stronger new materials that do not easily tear that could be used in aircraft, for example. Professor Robert Ritchie, a materials scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, California, who was one of the co-authors of the research, said: 'Our study is the first to model and directly observe in real time the micro-scale behavior of the collagen fibrils associated with the skin’s remarkable tear resistance. 'Collagen fibrils and fibers rotate, straighten, stretch and slide to carry load and reduce the stresses at the tip of any tear in the skin. 'The movement of the collagen acts to effectively diminish stress concentrations associated with any hole, notch or tear.' To conduct the experiment the researchers used the skin taken from dead rabbits, carefully removed the hair and placed it in equipment designed to pull the skin apart. They then cut a small notch or hole in the skin and watched how it changed shape as the skin was stretched in a way intended to cause the tear to increase. However, rather than getting bigger as the skin tore, the notches simply yawned open. The researchers, whose work is published in the journal Nature Communications, then used the x-ray beams produced by the Advanced Light Source at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, to study the structural changes that took place in the skin. They found the collagen in the dermis, the thickest of the three main layers that make up skin, changed its alignment at the edge of the tear. The collagen, which is normally in a disordered tangle, straightened and began to slide against each other to absorb the stress and provide extra strength. The researchers found the collagen in the skin dermis changes from being a disordered tangle (shown left) to line up in straight parallel rows (shown right) when skin is damaged to provide strength and tear resistance . Dr Marc Meyers, a materials scientist at the University of California San Diego who also took part in the research, said: 'Straightening and stretching allow the uptake of strain without much stress increase, and sliding allows more energy dissipation during inelastic deformation. 'This reorganization of the fibrils is responsible for blunting the stress at the tips of tears and notches.' Research on skin's mechanical properties dates back nearly 200 years, when physicians began examining stab wounds. The graphic above shows what happens to a notch in skin when it is stretched (left) compared to bone (right) Unlike bone and teeth, which are also made of collagen fibres but tear and crack when under stress, the collagen in the skin appears to change its structure when placed under stress. The researchers behind the latest study are working with the US Air Force Office of Scientific Research.

The scientists carried out experiments on real skin samples and discovered that the collagen that makes up our skin adapts by stretching and sharing the load when methods are applied to tear it. The scientists believe their findings could eventually lead to stronger new materials, offering early applications in aircraft design. Scientists from Gillette have also revealed their nine years of work and show what the perfect shave entails. The research shows that before shaving one should hydrate the hair by washing the skin with a gentle cleanser, apply plenty of shave gel, use a multi-blade razor, change direction of the blade and ensure the blade is not old or dull. Finally, aftershave should be used to sterilise and moisturise the skin.
","It is probably the most unpleasant experiment you will read about today: what happens when your skin starts to tear. Researchers have uncovered the reason why skin is so difficult to tear even when put under extreme pressures, by cutting samples of real skin and attempting to pull them apart. They found that rather than simply tearing, mammalian skin actually has sophisticated stress resistance properties that prevent holes and cuts from expanding. The researchers cut real skin samples and then attempted to rip them by pulling them apart (shown above) Using X-ray beams they were able to directly observe the microscopic changes that take place in skin to help it resist tearing during their stomach churning experiments. They discovered that the curly fibers of collagen that make up dermis of the skin straighten and stretch in response to a tear to share the load and prevent further damage. Scientists at Gillette have spent nine years studying how to get the perfect shave. Their work has shown why washing the skin is so vital and why you should never, ever tap your razor on the sink, and also settles the debate about whether you should go with, or against the grain . Here are their main findings: . Before the shave, hydrate the hair by washing the skin with a gentle cleanser: This softens the hair and significantly reduces the force needed to cut it. Apply plenty of shave gel: This provides a protective anti-friction layer and improves razor glide for a smoother, more comfortable shave. Shave with a  multi-blade razor using light strokes: Gillette said the razor should do the work, not the person shaving. Change direction: Begin by shaving with the grain of the hair before switching and going against this grain. Make sure blades are not old or dull: The lifespan of razors can vary depending on how often they are used and how hard. As a general rule if the razor begins to drag or doesn't cut as closely as before, replace the blades. Use aftershave: This can be any product containing moisturiser to rehydrate and comfort the skin. Many aftershaves contain alcohol that acts as an astringent to sterilise the skin and provide a barrier against infection. The findings help to explain why the thin layer of cells that cover our bodies is able to provide such an effective barrier to the outside world.

From his point of view, ISIS militants might be just hours away from taking the key Iraqi city of Ramadi. Fierce fighting has engulfed Ramadi, which lies only about 70 miles (113 kilometers) west of Baghdad and is the capital of Anbar province, Iraq's Sunni heartland. Essawi, the deputy head of the Anbar Provincial Council, told CNN from inside the city Wednesday that it's unclear how much longer government troops can hold their front lines against the ISIS offensive. The politician said he was on a front line himself, armed with a machine gun. Security was ""collapsing rapidly in the city,"" and he begged the Iraqi government for reinforcements and the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS for air support. He stressed that urgent support from the military and security forces is needed to save the city. ""This is what we warned Baghdad of what's going to happen,"" Essawi told CNN by phone, referring to the Iraqi government at the capital. ""Where is Baghdad? Where is al-Abadi?"" His plea for help comes the day after Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi met with U.S. President Barack Obama in Washington to seek more support for the fight against ISIS. ""Just Allah knows if we will survive this,"" Essawi said. According to the Anbar official, at least 10 Iraqi security forces were killed and more than 100 others were wounded in the fighting against ISIS on Wednesday. The extremist group's offensive in Ramadi shows its resilience despite months of U.S.-led airstrikes and its recent defeat by Iraqi forces in the northern city of Tikrit. ISIS fighters have Ramadi under pressure from several angles. Essawi said ISIS militants made significant advances Wednesday in three areas east of Ramadi: Albu Soda, Albu Ghanem and parts of Soufia, which leads to central Ramadi. Later, he said that militants were rolling into the center of Ramadi. Over the weekend, the militants seized control of areas north of Ramadi. Routes south of the city were taken some months ago. That leaves only areas to the west of Ramadi in the hands of government forces, but those positions are under threat, Essawi warned. The recent fighting has driven a steady stream of refugees out of the city. On Wednesday, some residents packed what they could into metal carts as they prepared to flee on foot. People also were fleeing the areas where ISIS was advancing east of Ramadi. At least 150,000 people have already fled since Wednesday morning, causing huge traffic jams on the roads leading outside the city, according to Essawi. A CNN team met with three families that had fled an ISIS assault in the Albu Ghanem area. Those families said Iraqi security and military forces withdrew from Albu Ghanem after a battle with ISIS, which took over the area quickly. One fleeing Albu Ghanem resident, Abu Ahmed, paused to talk to CNN as he and his family walked east toward Baghdad, crossing a bridge over the Euphrates River. He said four ISIS militants had entered his house and set up a sniper position on his roof. Abu Ahmed said he, his wife and four children walked away from the home with his elderly mother while the ISIS fighters were busy setting things up there. He said his family left everything behind. His family was using a cart to carry his mother, who couldn't walk. While talking about the fighters' takeover of his home, his wife started crying and asked God to help the rest of the families who are stuck in Albu Ghanem. Ramadi has seen intense and persistent fighting for months. ISIS took over parts of the city in the first half of last year, placing it at the heart of a deadly tug of war ever since. The U.S. military has carried out multiple airstrikes against ISIS targets near Ramadi in recent weeks. ""The coalition has been supporting the fight in Ramadi with airstrikes, and there have been seven airstrikes in Ramadi since Monday,"" Col. Ed Thomas, spokesman for Joint Chiefs Chairman Col. Martin Dempsey, said on Wednesday. He stressed that Ramadi remains contested. Another U.S. military official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told CNN that the fall of Ramadi is ""not imminent.""

Mack and her 21-year-old boyfriend Tommy Schaefer are awaiting sentencing in Indonesia after being accused of murdering Mack’s mother.

","The daughter of Chicago socialite Sheila Von Wiese-Mack accused of brutally murdering her mother during a Bali vacation will turn over a 'significant percentage' of her $1.3million trust fund to care for her newborn daughter. Vanessa Favia, attorney for 19-year-old Heather Mack, has filed court documents for her client agreeing to turn over funds for the care of four-month-old Stella. CBS reports the petition asks for around a half a million dollars to be transferred to Stella, who was born in Kerobakan Prison and who has urgent needs, including clothing and baby wipes. Scroll down for video . Child care: A US-based attorney for Heather Mack, 19, who is accused of murdering her socialite mother in Bali, has filed for about half a million dollars to be transferred to Mack's daughter Stella from Mack's trust fund . Heather Mack smiles at her baby daughter Stella before her sentencing hearing in Denpasar, Bali, in March . Mack wept as prosecutors said she should be sentenced to 15 years - but spared her the death penalty . 'What ever your opinion of the adults in this case, I believe everyone would agree that the baby bears no culpability in this truly sad affair,' Favia said in a press release. Mack filed a claim in court back in February that her uncle, Wiese-Mack's brother and trustee of her estate, had blocked her access to the funds, according to NBC. A judge ordered $150,000 be released to pay for Mack's defense, along with another $2,240 for living expenses, but required that Mack not share the money with anyone. Indonesian officials accused Mack of helping her 21-year-old boyfriend, Tommy Schaefer, murder her mother at a luxury Bali hotel before stuffing her body in a suitcase last August. The pair are awaiting sentencing, with prosecutors having asked for a sentence of 15 years for Mack and 18 for Schaefer. Chief Prosecutor Eddy Arta Wijaya said Mack 'committed sadistic acts to her own mother,' but wanted her to be spared the death penalty 'because she repeatedly expressed remorse and has a newborn baby.' The 21-year-old gazes at his baby daughter, held by a relative, before his sentence demand hearing . Mack claimed her daughter - who had to return to hospital shortly after her birth with jaundice - has six fingers on her left hand . Since being held in jail, the 19-year-old from Chicago has been keeping her newborn Stella with her in the crowded cell in Bali's Kerobokan prison. In a bizarre comment from her holding cell last week, Mack said with a grin that Stella has six fingers on her left hand, saying, 'But don't worry, she's OK, thank you.' As she waited in the cell, nervously puffing on a cigarette, Mack added that she and her co-accused boyfriend were married 'in spirit.' She said: 'He has made us a ring each to wear from his side of the prison.' She held up a hand revealing a red plastic ring. 'Tommy's is blue,' she added. Jail sentences of less than 20 years for each of the defendants are far more lenient than the death penalty or lifetime in prison that many had expected to be handed down for the gruesome crime. Schaefer has admitted to hitting Wiese-Mack with the metal handle of a fruit bowl in self-defense while his girlfriend has been accused of helping him to force the body into a suitcase, which was then loaded into the trunk of a taxi they had ordered. The couple did not board the taxi, however, instead leaving the hotel by a rear exit. They tried to leave Bali through the airport but they did not have their passports, which were being held in a safe deposit box at the hotel. Mack and Schaefer were arrested the following day at another Bali hotel. Mack, who said during an earlier court hearing that she did not wish her mother dead, said they panicked after Schaefer’s attack with the metal bowl. She said they thought about either calling the police or taking the body in a suitcase to the US Consulate. She did not explain why they did not do either one. When the prison gates opened to allow the couple to exit last month, onlookers were surprised to see Schaefer carrying baby Stella - the first time he had been seen with her . Shortly after the baby's birth Mack was being accused by prison sources of failing to wash the child properly . Mack said she intended to continue breastfeeding for two years. The baby was born on March 17 and had to be treated in the jail clinic and then in hospital after developing a high fever and jaundice. The child was later allowed to be taken back to the prison with her mother.

76,2b1b6a434b171e198413479aaba118f0cd20c843_gpt3_gen,"Loretta Lynch was nominated as the first African-American woman to become Attorney General in November 2014, but after being confirmed by the Judiciary Committee has yet to receive a full Senate vote. Already the wait has lasted longer for Lynch than any previous nominee to any cabinet position has waited in the last thirty years; by the time the Senate returns from recess on Monday, that period will have been longer than the wait time for the previous eight nominees combined. Senators from both parties have cited different reasons for the delay, with some blaming the Senate’s focus on the stalled trafficking bill, and other attributing the slow progress to retaliation against President Obama’s 2014 immigration actions.
","Durham, North Carolina (CNN)President Obama's nomination of Loretta Lynch to become the country's first African-American woman attorney general is a historic pick.  Her confirmation, however, is now taking on new historical relevance as her wait for a confirmation vote by the full Senate drags into its sixth month. The period between the Senate Judiciary Committee's vote to confirm and the full Senate vote -- which in Lynch's case has not been scheduled -- has lasted longer for her than for any attorney general nominee in recent history. By the time the Senate returns from Easter recess on Monday, it'll have been longer than the eight previous nominees for the job -- combined. Lynch, currently the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, cleared the committee February 26 by a vote of 12-8, with Republican Sens. Orrin Hatch of Utah, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Jeff Flake of Arizona joining Democrats in sending the nomination to the full Senate. Obama nominated Lynch to replace Attorney General Eric Holder on November 8, after Holder had announced plans to leave the post weeks earlier. Hundreds of miles from Washington, longtime residents of Durham, North Carolina, were beaming with pride.  Lynch's family moved to the city when she was a child.  Her parents, married for 60 years, still live there.  They watched the announcement on television . ""That was encouraging but I knew then that we had a fight on our hands,"" said Lynch's father, the Rev. Lorenzo Lynch.  ""I've been in politics most of my life. I know that nothing is certain, and I know that nothing is easy."" Lorenzo Lynch, 82, is a retired Baptist preacher and was active in the civil rights movement of the 1960s.  He ran, unsuccessfully, for mayor of Durham in 1973. For the next round of his daughter's ""fight,"" he traveled to Washington in late January to attend his daughter's confirmation hearing before the Judiciary Committee. ""I heard a lot at that hearing that I've heard since childhood.  That is the presupposition of the mindset,"" Lorenzo Lynch said.  ""The dual system or the dual treatment."" When asked to provide specific examples, Lorenzo Lynch deferred to the state branch of the NAACP and E. Lavonia Allison, a Durham activist who has known Loretta Lynch since the family moved to Durham. ""I don't want to think about the epidermis, but some people are thinking that way,"" Allison said, suggesting that Lynch's confirmation vote has been delayed because Lynch is African-American. ""When it has taken so long, when it has been so different from any other person who has been nominated ... how else can we interpret that it is so different?"" Allison said. In March, Rep. G.K. Butterfield, D-North Carolina, chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said, ""I think race certainly can be considered as a major factor in the reason for this delay, but it's also the irrationality of the new Republicans."" Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, evoked imagery of the segregated South in criticism of Republicans, saying Lynch had been ""asked to sit in the back of the bus when it comes to the Senate calendar."" Durbin was harshly criticized by Arizona's Sen. John McCain. ""I deeply regret that the senator from Illinois chose to come here yesterday and question the integrity and motivation, mine and my Republican colleagues,"" McCain said on the Senate floor.  ""It was offensive and unnecessary, and I think he owes this body, Ms. Lynch and all Americans an apology,"" McCain added. ""I thought he should be commended,"" Lorenzo Lynch said.  ""I think that's a poetic description of what has happened and poetry, like most language, is limited but it does have wings ... to carry a point."" Giuliani pushes for Lynch confirmation . Senate Republicans adamantly deny the delay in scheduling a vote on Lynch's nomination is because she is African-American. Many point out that Lynch, if confirmed, will be replacing the country's first African-American attorney general who was confirmed by an overwhelming margin. Instead, Republicans and Democrats say the delay is part of an ongoing partisan battle.  For some, it's part of a fight over a human trafficking bill that has stalled in the Senate.  For others, the delay is retaliation for President Obama's 2014 executive actions on immigration. On the eve of Holder's announcement of his plans to leave the Department of Justice, the political number crunchers at FiveThirtyEight.com predicted that whoever the President nominated would ""likely face at least a moderately tough confirmation hearing in the Senate."" Some of Lynch's supporters across North Carolina have organized to convince the state's two Republican senators to support Lynch's confirmation.  In March, several dozen North Carolina women, led by the NAACP, traveled to Washington to meet with their senators, Richard Burr and Thom Tillis. Reportedly, the meeting lasted nearly an hour and was very cordial. At a news conference at the Washington Press Club, the group blasted the senators for opposing the nomination. ""Senator Burr and Senator Tillis, it is time for you to act like you have some sense.  It's past time.  You have embarrassed the state of North Carolina,"" Allison said after the meeting. For their part, Burr and Tillis released a statement after the meeting: ""While we remain concerned with Ms. Lynch's stated desire to lead the Department of Justice in the same manner as Eric Holder and will not be supporting her nomination, we are grateful that the group came to Washington to talk about this issue and exchange ideas. Weeks later, the NAACP organized protests outside the senators' offices in Raleigh, Charlotte and Wilmington. ""I think there is a much deeper analysis,"" said North Carolina NAACP Branch President Rev. William Barber II.  ""I believe if she had been Clarence Thomas, she would have been confirmed."" ""Because of her courage, her character and her commitment to the law and to the enforcement of the laws of this land, particularly the 14th and 15th amendments to the Constitution, and because her consciousness was shaped in the crucible of the civil rights movement -- that is what they fear,"" Barber said. Obama turns up the heat on Loretta Lynch confirmation 'limbo' Lorenzo Lynch says he carried his daughter to several civil rights marches on his shoulders.  He admits that he did not think that much of the recent progress of African-Americans was possible when he was fighting for equal rights. Now, his small living room is filled with stacks of loosely organized newspaper stories about his daughter's nomination and photos of his visit to the White House. Lynch admits that he's never told his only daughter that he's proud of her, although he's sure she knows it.  He plans to change that, soon, regardless of the outcome of her pending nomination.",cnndm_generic,GPT 3.5,"Already the wait has lasted longer for Lynch than any previous nominee to any cabinet position has waited in the last thirty years; by the time the Senate returns from recess on Monday, that period will have been longer than the wait time for the previous eight nominees combined.",non_factual,non_factual,minor,minor,extrinsic,extrinsic,nonfactual,nonfactual,There is no confirmation that it is the longest wait in the last thirty years.,

Her confirmation, however, is now taking on new historical relevance as her wait for a confirmation vote by the full Senate drags into its sixth month. The period between the Senate Judiciary Committee's vote to confirm and the full Senate vote -- which in Lynch's case has not been scheduled -- has lasted longer for her than for any attorney general nominee in recent history. By the time the Senate returns from Easter recess on Monday, it'll have been longer than the eight previous nominees for the job -- combined. Lynch, currently the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, cleared the committee February 26 by a vote of 12-8, with Republican Sens. Orrin Hatch of Utah, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Jeff Flake of Arizona joining Democrats in sending the nomination to the full Senate. Obama nominated Lynch to replace Attorney General Eric Holder on November 8, after Holder had announced plans to leave the post weeks earlier. Hundreds of miles from Washington, longtime residents of Durham, North Carolina, were beaming with pride.  Lynch's family moved to the city when she was a child.  Her parents, married for 60 years, still live there.  They watched the announcement on television . ""That was encouraging but I knew then that we had a fight on our hands,"" said Lynch's father, the Rev. Lorenzo Lynch.  ""I've been in politics most of my life. I know that nothing is certain, and I know that nothing is easy."" Lorenzo Lynch, 82, is a retired Baptist preacher and was active in the civil rights movement of the 1960s.  He ran, unsuccessfully, for mayor of Durham in 1973. For the next round of his daughter's ""fight,"" he traveled to Washington in late January to attend his daughter's confirmation hearing before the Judiciary Committee. ""I heard a lot at that hearing that I've heard since childhood.  That is the presupposition of the mindset,"" Lorenzo Lynch said.  ""The dual system or the dual treatment."" When asked to provide specific examples, Lorenzo Lynch deferred to the state branch of the NAACP and E. Lavonia Allison, a Durham activist who has known Loretta Lynch since the family moved to Durham. ""I don't want to think about the epidermis, but some people are thinking that way,"" Allison said, suggesting that Lynch's confirmation vote has been delayed because Lynch is African-American.

79,34285841_flant5_gen,A coastal town in central Chile has been declared a state of emergency after a powerful earthquake and tsunami.,"At least 11 people died in Wednesday's 8.3-magnitude quake - the strongest in the world this year -  that sent tsunami waves as far away as Japan.
The coastal town of Coquimbo, close to the epicentre, saw waves of 4.7m (15ft) hit the shore.
Hundreds of people spent Thursday night in temporary shelters, while tens of thousands are without electricity.
About one million people had to leave their homes after Chile sounded a tsunami alert when the quake struck, although most are reported to have returned.
Tsunami waves also hit the coast further north and south of the quake's epicentre, with waves half a metre higher than usual as far north as La Punta.
Gloria Navarro, who lives in the coastal town of La Serena, said people were ""running in all directions"".
""Everything is a mess,"" restaurant owner Melisa Pinones told Reuters from the city of Illapel. ""It was a disaster, a total loss.""
Across parts of central Chile, residents began clearing up after what was the country's sixth most powerful recorded earthquake.
Large parts of the sea front in the fishing village of Tongoy were destroyed, and more than 500 homes were badly damaged across the region, according to emergency response teams.
Emergency powers mean aid will reach Coquimbo quicker, and allow troops to be deployed on to the region's streets.
Visiting Coquimbo on Thursday, President Michelle Bachelet paid tribute to people's response, saying that the death toll, ""while unfortunate, was not very high considering the strength of the earthquake"".
The US Geological Survey (USGS) said the tremor struck off the coast of Coquimbo, 46km (29 miles) west of the city of Illapel at 19:54 local time (22:54 GMT).
The USGS said it was at a depth of 25km, while Chilean seismologists calculated its depth at 11km.
Small tsunami waves were felt along the west coast of the US and Canada. A one-metre (3ft) wave also reached in Hawaii.
The earthquake struck as thousands of Chileans were travelling to the coast ahead of a week of celebrations for independence day.

Fish die-offs are a frequent occurrence in Rio's waterways, which are choked with raw sewage and rubbish.

","A 'perfect' mansion which has been sold for £51million in an exclusive part of London has become one of the UK's most expensive  homes - and the buyer also has to pay £7.6m in stamp duty. The sprawling house, built on the site of an old telephone exchange in Chelsea, west London, has been sold for 300 times the average price of home in England and Wales. But the stamp duty alone, paid on top of the price of the home, is enough for the Treasury to pay the annual salary of 330 nurses. This sprawling house, built on the site of an old telephone exchange in Chelsea, west London, has been sold for 300 times the average price of home in England and Wales . The transaction means it is one of the most expensive homes to ever sell in the UK. Spread across four floors, the house is 18 times the size of the average new home, with nine bedrooms, nine bathrooms, a cinema, a Japanese water garden and an indoor swimming pool. The owner, who commissioned the mansion, had put the house on the market for £55 million. It has now been bought by an offshore company  for £51,191,950, according to Land Registry figures. A spokesman for Knight Frank, which sold the home, would not comment further. The property is situated on Boltons Place, at the top of The Boltons, an exclusive street made up of late 19th and early 20th Century mansions. The huge tax bill, the equivalent to 15 per cent, is down to the buyer using a Bermuda-based company to buy the property. Under the Annual Tax on Enveloped Dwellings (ATED), which is payable by companies that own UK residential property, there is a further bill of £218,200 each year.

She said in an earlier statement: ""We explained that students who arrived to school with a uniform issue that could be resolved would be sent home to rectify and parents would be contacted.
""As forewarned, some students were sent home for this reason.
""They were sent home to change and the majority rectified this immediately and returned to school ready to learn.""
The principal said rules were an important part of growing up to get students ready for ""adult life"".
She said: ""This is part and parcel of a much wider push on conduct, on behaviour, on attitudes and respect.
""Uniform and the way in which we wear our clothes is all part and parcel of the way in which we communicate with each other.
""It is all part of the educational experience which you would find in any good to outstanding school.""
Caren Oxlaide's son was one of those sent home for not wearing the regulation black leather shoes.
She said: ""It states black shoes, lace-up, no trainers and flat-soled. That's exactly what his are, pure leather.""
She said buying new shoes was not an easy option.
""I can't really afford them, not on income support. But I've got to somehow do it because my son's education is important.""
Diane Hickey's daughter Cassidy, 13, was sent home on Wednesday because she was wearing black pumps.
""I'm not buying her a new pair of shoes. I'm a single parent. I can't afford a new pair of shoes,"" she said.

Despite her confident public speaking ability, Thomas has battled with her condition and the reactions of others to her appearance and has at times contemplated suicide. The illness necessitates Thomas to bathe for four hours each day and carry several tubs of cream to moisturise her skin. Thomas, along with her parents, now speaks at schools around Hong Kong about her condition and its social impact.
","Hong Kong (CNN)When she was growing up, Mui Thomas, wanted to be a fashion model -- not an unusual aspiration for a young girl. But Mui suffers from a rare genetic condition that leaves the skin on her face and body red raw and open to infection. ""I really don't think I knew that I didn't look like everybody else,"" she says. She was born with Harlequin ichthyosis, which means her skin is extremely thick, dry and flaky -- resembling fish scales. She can't sweat but she can shed tears. On the day we speak, her appearance raises few eyebrows at her local Starbucks in Sai Kung -- she's a familiar and well-known presence in the waterfront Hong Kong town where she grew up. Mui's struggle to come to terms with her condition and other people's reactions to it has, at times, left her on the brink of suicide. But, now 22, she refuses to let it get in the way of her life -- she has a full-time job, plays sport and is embarking on a career as public speaker -- educating and inspiring others about the challenges of looking ""visibly different."" After she was abandoned at birth, long-time Hong Kong expats Tina and Rog Thomas began fostering Mui, when she was just one and a half years old. They were told she didn't have long to live. ""We wanted to give her a family life in the time she had,"" says Tina. However, Mui began to thrive in a loving family environment and Tina and Rog formally adopted Mui when she was three years old. Together they gradually learned how to manage her skin condition. Each day she bathes twice, ideally for two hours each time, and everywhere she goes she carries a backpack with three or four tubs of cream that she must apply throughout the day to stop her skin from drying out. She's thought to be the fourth oldest person alive with harlequin ichthyosis. The oldest is 31. But while Mui's unusual appearance made little difference during her early years, that changed when she started secondary school. The school she attended required that she be accompanied by a educational assistant, which put up a barrier between her and the other children and made it difficult for her to make friends. Things got worse when she became a victim of cyberbullying. She began to deny her appearance, stopped bathing, taking her medication and applying the cream. At times, she considered jumping from the balcony of her home. ""They'd say things like 'You shouldn't have been born' -- and very personal things that only people who knew me would know,"" she says. ""It made me very wary of everybody. Even when people tried to be nice, I didn't repay it. I didn't trust them."" The worst episode lasted for 10 months and only stopped after police became involved and found the bully -- someone whom Mui thought was her friend. Mui left school with no qualifications. She says the school didn't push her to study and made too many allowances for her skin disorder. ""I still wish I had got a very hard kick up the backside from the teachers when I wasn't doing work,"" says Mui. Since leaving school, Mui has found a full-time job working with people with special needs and at weekends can be found running around a rugby pitch with a whistle -- she's a referee for kids' matches. Along with her parents, she's also begun speaking about her experiences of living with a ""visible difference"" and cyberbullying at schools around Hong Kong.

103,36154201_gpt3_gen,"South Yorkshire Police Chief Constable, David Crompton, has been suspended following criticism of his handling of the Hillsborough disaster. The move follows a jury ruling that the 96 Liverpool fans who lost their lives during the 1989 disaster were unlawfully killed, due to police failings. During this week’s inquest conclusion, Burnham accused Crompton’s force of going back on its 2012 apology to victims and called for his resignation. Crompton was already due to retire in November. Deputy Chief Constable Dawn Copley has temporarily taken over the role. This is the fourth time since November 2012 that a Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) has suspended a chief constable, highlighting the power of such directly-elected roles.
","Jurors concluded the 96 victims of the 1989 disaster were unlawfully killed and there were police failings.
Shadow Home Secretary Andy Burnham said ""those responsible must be held to account"" saying the force had gone back on its 2012 apology.
The force's Police and Crime Commissioner said there had been an ""erosion of trust"".
Dr Alan Billings said he had no choice but to act.
The PCC said: ""The continuing criticism that has been directed at the Chief Constable and the eroding trust and confidence in South Yorkshire Police I have been left with no choice other than to suspend David Crompton from his duties.
""I have reached this decision with a heavy heart following discussions with David.""
Mr Crompton was due to retire in November after four years in the role.
Hillsborough campaigner Margaret Aspinall, whose son James died in the tragedy, welcomed the suspension.
""The system, the police force of South Yorkshire, ought to be ashamed of themselves and hang their heads in shame,"" she told crowds gathered at a vigil in Liverpool in memory of those who died,
She added: ""Let's hope that's only the beginning of what's going to happen - we have had 27 years of sleepless nights - let's hope you are getting yours now.""
About 30,000 were estimated to be at the vigil, where flowers and scarves were laid on the steps of St George's Hall in the city centre.
Mr Burnham, who has backed the campaign for justice for the Hillsborough victims, had called for Mr Crompton's resignation in the House of Commons.
He said the force had gone back on its 2012 public apology following the release of the Hillsborough Independent Panel report.
Mr Burnham said: ""Shamefully, the cover-up continued in this Warrington court room. Millions of pounds of public money were spent retelling discredited lies.
""Lawyers for retired officers threw disgusting slurs; those for today's force tried to establish that others were responsible for the opening of the gate.
""If the police had chosen to maintain its apology, these inquests would have been much shorter.""
Responding to calls for the force to be disbanded, Dr Billings said it was ""too big a step"".
Although the PCC Dr Alan Billings suggests the decision to suspend David Crompton was triggered by reaction to the Hillsborough verdict, Mr Crompton's position has been under intense scrutiny for several years.
In 2013 he had to apologise after accusing a Hillsborough campaign group of lying. In a memo written before the Independent Panel report on the tragedy, Mr Crompton had said his force needed to be ""innovative"" in its media handling otherwise they'd ""just be roadkill.""
A year later, he came in for further criticism over South Yorkshire Police's search of Sir Cliff Richard's home, and last month a damning report revealed serious flaws in the way the force investigated child sexual exploitation.
After the report was released, Mr Crompton announced he'd be retiring in November.
Dr Billings' action could hasten the chief constable's departure but it illustrates a wider point: the power wielded by directly-elected police and crime commissioners. It is the fourth time since November 2012 that a PCC has suspended a chief constable - something that was very rarely seen under the previous system of police authorities.
Lawyers acting on behalf of the 22 of the families welcomed the suspension.
The statement from Broudie Jackson Canter said: ""We hope and expect that his conduct will be subject to the rigorous and impartial scrutiny which has so long been denied to the families.""
Deputy Chief Constable Dawn Copley has temporarily taken over the chief role.
In a statement, she said she had been ""asked to act as Temporary Chief Constable"" by the PCC ""which I have agreed to do"".
""This is a significant day for South Yorkshire Police.
""However, we are absolutely determined to maintain our focus on delivering the best possible policing services to the communities of South Yorkshire,"" she added.
In 2012, Mr Crompton admitted ""grave errors"" were made during the Hillsborough disaster and has apologised ""profoundly"".
On Tuesday after the inquests conclusions were delivered, he admitted the policing of the match was ""catastrophically wrong"" and ""unequivocally"" accepted the findings.
Hours before his suspension, the force said: ""We have never sought, at any stage, to defend the failures of South Yorkshire Police or its officers.
""Nevertheless, these failures had to be put into the context of other contributory factors. In other words, where do the failings of SYP stand in the overall picture?

104,36154201_flant5_gen,South Yorkshire Police's chief constable David Crompton has been suspended after the Hillsborough inquests.,"Jurors concluded the 96 victims of the 1989 disaster were unlawfully killed and there were police failings.
Shadow Home Secretary Andy Burnham said ""those responsible must be held to account"" saying the force had gone back on its 2012 apology.
The force's Police and Crime Commissioner said there had been an ""erosion of trust"".
Dr Alan Billings said he had no choice but to act.
The PCC said: ""The continuing criticism that has been directed at the Chief Constable and the eroding trust and confidence in South Yorkshire Police I have been left with no choice other than to suspend David Crompton from his duties.
""I have reached this decision with a heavy heart following discussions with David.""
Mr Crompton was due to retire in November after four years in the role.
Hillsborough campaigner Margaret Aspinall, whose son James died in the tragedy, welcomed the suspension.
""The system, the police force of South Yorkshire, ought to be ashamed of themselves and hang their heads in shame,"" she told crowds gathered at a vigil in Liverpool in memory of those who died,
She added: ""Let's hope that's only the beginning of what's going to happen - we have had 27 years of sleepless nights - let's hope you are getting yours now.""
About 30,000 were estimated to be at the vigil, where flowers and scarves were laid on the steps of St George's Hall in the city centre.
Mr Burnham, who has backed the campaign for justice for the Hillsborough victims, had called for Mr Crompton's resignation in the House of Commons.
He said the force had gone back on its 2012 public apology following the release of the Hillsborough Independent Panel report.
Mr Burnham said: ""Shamefully, the cover-up continued in this Warrington court room. Millions of pounds of public money were spent retelling discredited lies.
""Lawyers for retired officers threw disgusting slurs; those for today's force tried to establish that others were responsible for the opening of the gate.
""If the police had chosen to maintain its apology, these inquests would have been much shorter.""
Responding to calls for the force to be disbanded, Dr Billings said it was ""too big a step"".
Although the PCC Dr Alan Billings suggests the decision to suspend David Crompton was triggered by reaction to the Hillsborough verdict, Mr Crompton's position has been under intense scrutiny for several years.
In 2013 he had to apologise after accusing a Hillsborough campaign group of lying. In a memo written before the Independent Panel report on the tragedy, Mr Crompton had said his force needed to be ""innovative"" in its media handling otherwise they'd ""just be roadkill.""
A year later, he came in for further criticism over South Yorkshire Police's search of Sir Cliff Richard's home, and last month a damning report revealed serious flaws in the way the force investigated child sexual exploitation.
After the report was released, Mr Crompton announced he'd be retiring in November.
Dr Billings' action could hasten the chief constable's departure but it illustrates a wider point: the power wielded by directly-elected police and crime commissioners. It is the fourth time since November 2012 that a PCC has suspended a chief constable - something that was very rarely seen under the previous system of police authorities.
Lawyers acting on behalf of the 22 of the families welcomed the suspension.
The statement from Broudie Jackson Canter said: ""We hope and expect that his conduct will be subject to the rigorous and impartial scrutiny which has so long been denied to the families.""
Deputy Chief Constable Dawn Copley has temporarily taken over the chief role.
In a statement, she said she had been ""asked to act as Temporary Chief Constable"" by the PCC ""which I have agreed to do"".
""This is a significant day for South Yorkshire Police.
""However, we are absolutely determined to maintain our focus on delivering the best possible policing services to the communities of South Yorkshire,"" she added.
In 2012, Mr Crompton admitted ""grave errors"" were made during the Hillsborough disaster and has apologised ""profoundly"".
On Tuesday after the inquests conclusions were delivered, he admitted the policing of the match was ""catastrophically wrong"" and ""unequivocally"" accepted the findings.
Hours before his suspension, the force said: ""We have never sought, at any stage, to defend the failures of South Yorkshire Police or its officers.
""Nevertheless, these failures had to be put into the context of other contributory factors. In other words, where do the failings of SYP stand in the overall picture?
""We are sorry if our approach has been perceived as at odds with our earlier apology, this was certainly not our intention.""

107,38323832_flant5_gen,Scientists are using radar satellites to map the movement of tectonic plates in the region where most earthquakes occur.,"The team is processing satellite images to show how rocks in a belt that stretches from Europe's Alps to China are slowly accumulating strain.
Movements on the scale of just millimetres per year are being sought.
The new maps are being made available to help researchers produce more robust assessments of seismic hazard.
The kind of change they are trying to chart is not noticeable in the everyday human sense, but over time will put faults under such pressure that they eventually rupture - often with catastrophic consequences.
""We may well discover regions that have very small strain rates that we have not been able to detect before,"" said Dr Richard Walters.
""And that may well tell us that earthquakes are more likely in some areas that traditionally have been thought of as being completely stable and not at risk of having earthquakes at all.""
Dr Walters is affiliated to the UK Centre for Observation and Modelling of Earthquakes, Volcanoes and Tectonics (COMET).
He announced the start of the new service here in San Francisco, at the Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union.
Key to the UK scientists' work is the high performance of the EU's new Sentinel-1 radar satellites.
This pair of spacecraft repeatedly and rapidly image the surface of the globe, throwing their data to the ground using a high-speed laser link. And by comparing whole stacks of their pictures in a technique known as interferometry, the COMET group can begin to see the very slow bending and buckling that occurs in the crust as a result of shifting tectonic plates.
To initiate the service, the researchers are concentrating on the Alpine-Himalayan seismic belt.
This is the sector where most of the deaths arising from big earthquakes occur.
In time, however, the mapping exercise will be extended to cover all major seismic hazard zones, including the rim of the Pacific basin - the so-called ""ring of fire"", where large tremors are also a regular occurrence.
To be really effective, the team's maps need to be sensitive to movements of about 1mm per year over 100km.
The system is not quite there yet, but as the Sentinels gather more and more images, the desired standard should be realised.
As a proof of principle - and to give an example of what the new system can do - the COMET group showed off its maps of Turkey at AGU.
These capture the 20-25mm/year westwards march of the Anatolian plateau relative to Eurasia.
The focus of interest is how tectonic strain is building up along the North and East Anatolian Faults - the trigger points for so many damaging quakes in the past.
Prof Tim Wright, the director of COMET, said one of the breakthroughs that had made the new service possible was simply the prodigious volumes of data the Sentinel satellite system could now feed to the ground.
""To give you an example, in just one year of Sentinel operation there are 156 terabytes of data; whereas the entire 10-year archive of Envisat (a previous European radar satellite) has just 24TB.
""And we now process the data from the Sentinels automatically within a few hours of getting it.""
Dr Walters added: ""This is a big data project. We've had funding from the UK's Natural Environment Research Council to build a big data-processing facility, to take these data from the European Space Agency, which they provide for free, and make useful geophysical measurements.
""We then serve that to the community. We put the data out there not just for us to analyse and think about seismic hazards, but for scientists all over the world to use.""
The ""Looking inside the Continents from Space"" project has just sent live a website where all the processed maps can be accessed.
COMET is also working on a very similar system that would allow scientists to track the behaviour of volcanoes. The Sentinels will also see their slow developing bulges of magma that may precede eruptions.

113,23794644_flant5_gen,"More than 19 million people in China could be at risk of drinking arsenic-contaminated water, according to a new study.","Scientists used information about the geology of the country to predict the areas most likely to be affected by the poison.
The report is published in the journal Science.
Arsenic occurs naturally in the Earth's crust, but if it leaches into groundwater, long-term exposure can cause serious health risks.
These include skin problems and cancers of the skin, lungs, bladder and kidney.
Geological maps
Until now, estimating the scale of arsenic contamination in large countries has been difficult.
China is thought to have more than 10 million drinking wells, and each needs to be screened to establish whether any toxic compounds are present. This process could take decades.
Instead, researchers from Switzerland and China looked at geological maps of the country.
Dr Annette Johnson, from the Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (EAWAG) and a co-author of the study, explained: ""In the last few years the amount of geospatial information - electronic maps - that's become available is large. You have information such as climate data, land use, and distance to the river or elevation.""
Using this information, and by looking at the types of rocks present in the country, and in particular their age, the researchers pinpointed the regions where the toxic element is most likely to be found.
Their findings suggest that 19.6 million people in China could be exposed to unsafe levels in their drinking water, including some living in areas areas not previously thought to be at risk.
Dr Johnson told the BBC World Service programme Science in Action: ""They are areas along river basins where there is irrigation and agriculture, including areas that were known previously such as the Huhhot basin in Inner Mongolia, but there are also new areas in the central Sichuan province and along the east coast.""
The researchers say the findings could help the Chinese authorities with their well-screening programmes.
Dr Johnson explained: ""What it is very important to do is to go to the areas that are hotspots and screen those first. The chances are you will find more contaminated wells than wells that are not contaminated.
""And in the other areas, you still have to make sure you do screening for arsenic, but it is probably not such a high priority.""
Wells that are contaminated could be either treated or taken out of use, she added.
The researchers believe this new prediction method could used elsewhere around the world.
Arsenic contamination of groundwater is found in central Europe, South America, parts of the US and Asia.
But one country that could benefit is Bangladesh, where arsenic poisoning has been described by the World Health Organization as a ""public health emergency"".
It is estimated that between 35 million and 77 million people there are at risk of drinking contaminated water.",xsum_generic,Flan T5,,factual,factual,,,,,,,,
